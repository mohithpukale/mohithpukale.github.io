for greater labour flexibility", "body": "an unusual consensus has emerged at least between the us and europe from the dozens of papers produced by governments and think tanks for the group of seven jobs summit which is to begin in detroit today even if there has been no new big idea for solving the developed world s unemployment problem the three main voices in the debate the us the uk and the continental european backed by economists at the organisation for economic co operation and development are all emphasising a combination of greater labour market flexibility easier enterprise formation more effective active labour market measures and improvements in education and training there is even a broad consensus around one of the central causes of unemployment in the developed world that a combination of trade with developing countries and technological change has permanently reduced demand for less skilled labour benefit systems and minimum wages put a floor under unskilled wages in europe so the fall in demand has shown in rising unemployment in the us on the other hand the problem is expressed in falling wages or resort to crime the policy challenge is to move as many people as possible into high skill jobs while ensuring that labour markets are flexible enough to soak up the rest without forcing down incomes too far by their attendance at the summit all g7 countries implicitly accept that social engineering to deal with this collapse in demand for unskilled labour and to cut the time lag between the destruction of old jobs and the creation of new ones is justified in political terms both free market liberals represented most strongly by the uk government and social christian democrats represented by continental europe and the european commission can sign to such a combination of ideas a democratic administration in the us interested in european welfare and training systems but still wedded to many aspects of its own flexible labour market hovers between the two but the idea of mid atlantic convergence can also be misleading because the meeting point is far closer to the us than to the european coast indeed the starting point of the most influential analysis is considerably more liberal and competitiveness conscious than a decade ago the emphasis in europe is on repairing the poor capacity of its economies to create new jobs in the us which has produced 2m new jobs in the past 18 months the emphasis is on producing higher skilled higher paid jobs all the main parties to the debate including the traditionally orthodox oecd are also careful to avoid advocating us style wage differentials and real wage cuts in 1972 1992 us average real wages fell by about 10 per cent even the uk government the strongest admirer of the us model talks about the balance to be struck between market forces and regulation the main clusters of ideas on the detroit agenda are wage and regulatory flexibility the oecd has long advocated that europe increase its labour cost flexibility and reform its job security provisions the most surprising recent convert to this orthodoxy has been the european commission the european commission s white paper on growth competitiveness and employment published at the end of last year talks about a new solidarity between the employed and the unemployed and about remodelled regulation rather than de regulation but it pulls few punches on the problems of european rigidity it says that many social protection schemes and wage bargaining systems have had a negative impact on employment protecting those in work at the expense of job seekers and says that there is broad consensus from member states on the need for greater flexibility and lower labour costs the most concrete policy proposal to create more jobs for the less skilled and increase the employment intensity of the services sector is to increase the burden of non wage labour costs as incomes rise at present the proportion falls as incomes rise in most european countries the us paper circulated to governments before the summit also stresses that the main policy requirement for europe and japan is to reduce restrictions on wage setting and employment adjustment which reduce the incentives of the unemployed to find jobs and the incentives of employers to create them training education and good jobs the us paper says that in the right climate of innovation and entrepreneurship new technology creates as many jobs as it destroys but if all citizens are to qualify for these jobs the standards of basic education and training must be improved especially in the us and the school to work transition must be better handled active labour markets and more flexible welfare the annual cost of unemployment in the eu including foregone income is more than ecu200bn pounds 151bn each year greater than the gdp of belgium in recent years there has been a small shift towards active labour market measures training job placement and so on but more than two thirds of direct spending on unemployment still goes on passive measures the challenge is to find ways of boosting the incomes of the unskilled in a more economically efficient manner than just leaving them on benefits the problem is that europe s social security systems were designed on the assumption of full time employment and have failed to adapt to the growth of part time and atypical employment individuals find it difficult to move from unemployment into anything other than full time work because of the steep claw back of benefits disagreements and other views there are of course differences of emphasis between the main participants with most european countries playing down cyclical factors and playing up structural factors while the us still believes that a good part of the unemployment problem is linked to low growth countries which pursue structural improvements without taking steps to increase aggregate demand will see little or no return for their efforts warns the us paper japan with the best record of any g7 country on jobs in recent years also warns in its otherwise orthodox paper against too much emphasis on labour flexibility excessive mobility of workers discourages incentives to enhance human resource development by enterprises it warns one idea not on the detroit agenda which runs strongly counter to economic orthodoxy is work sharing the eu white paper was ambivalent about it rejecting a generalised reduction in working hours and job sharing at national level even so as a preferable alternative to widespread

oscillated between 4 9 per cent and 9 7 per cent in the 1970s and 1980s much lower than comparable european rates although some workers may give up the search for work quicker than they might in

job creation picked up to 1 8 per cent more robust but still weak by the standards of most post war recoveries a new study by economists steven davis john haltiwanger and scott schuh at the census bureau s centre for economic studies shows that the gross creation and destruction of jobs that produces these net annual figures is far more dramatic looking at data from individual manufacturing plants from 1973 to 1988 they found that in a typical 12 month period 10 3 per cent of jobs disappeared while another 9 1 per cent were newly created while us workers have been finding jobs their earnings adjusted for inflation have fared worse average weekly earnings in the private sector measured in 1982 dollars climbed from dollars 261 92 in 1960 to dollars 315 38 in 1973 since then they have slipped back steadily to only dollars 255 99 at the end of 1993 within this overall decline workers in the highest wages bracket saw their earnings rise by an average of 4 4 per cent in real terms over the last 20 years while workers in the bottom wage bracket saw a real fall in earnings of 10 3 per cent another census bureau study published last week shows that 18 per cent of america s 81m full time workers earned less than a poverty level wage of dollars 13 091 a year compared with only 12 per cent in 1979 some european countries while they may not have escaped the erosion of real wages have avoided this increase in inequality this does not just mean that the superior record of job creation in the us has come entirely in low wage low skill sectors such as fast food restaurants the us economy has not been producing mcjobs disproportionately says ms laura tyson chair of the white house council of economic advisers we have been creating jobs in good job classification categories but that rate of growth of compensation of those jobs has slowed some of the pressure on earnings has come from the spiralling cost of health insurance which is provided in most cases by employers who generally pass on around 80 per cent of the costs to their workers in lower wages but even measures of total compensation including health benefits have grown at a rate the clinton administration finds disappointing the question ministers will address today and tomorrow is in the words of mr robert reich us labour secretary are the citizens of advanced economies condemned to choose between on the one hand more jobs which pay less and less or good jobs but high levels of unemployment accompanying those good jobs i think there s a third choice and that third choice may be

having to take the risk of going to the markets for new money the distortion of competition was too flagrant not to be noticed said la tribune in language that could have come and undoubtedly will out

have no legitimacy as a self proclaimed state if they do not negotiate he added but the overriding consideration with regard to the status and fate of the krajina serbs is the extent to which they can

about increases domestic consumers whose power supplies are protected by long term hedging contracts will not benefit unless prices stay at such low levels for some months which is unlikely in the

electricity from the pool is bought by large energy users and regional electricity companies which distribute it to the public the biggest loser from the price fall is nuclear electric which earns more of its income through selling to the pool than the two largest generators and is less protected by hedging against unexpected price fluctuations ironically the record low prices come at the end

nice outfits that they personally can buy and wear next season some designers agree other designers however think of the runway show both as spectacle and as a forum for ideas ideas isn t that you might well mutter a little pretentious we re talking frocks here but the truth about vivienne westwood and the homosexual male designers indicted for misogyny last week is that their medium is not only bits of cloth it is woman s identity particularly her sexual identity and it is inevitable that just as in an art gallery or a theatre the more exploratory and experimental the designer s ideas the more they will shock us amuse us make us think a little the fashion designer s vocabulary is composed of the many images of femaleness which women have worn through the centuries of human civilisation as with a living language new words must be coined to describe new concepts but their roots will be in words which already exist twenty five years after the start of the second phase of women s mobilisation for equality we are still seeking new definitions of femininity arguably this is an endless search any new definition must come partly out of the old predominant are those essentially male fantasies which we now categorise as pornographic but in whose creation and westwood for one is quite clear on this women colluded they are female identities modern woman needs to confront and explore on the runways of paris and of london milan and new york designers male and female homo and heterosexual use the vocabulary at their disposal to do that westwood just does it more self consciously and with more humour playing with archetypes and goading us to deconstruct them breasts have had a lot of her attention she has explored their erotic potential from maximum artificiality to complete naturalness and so on her heels have the other designers indeed nowadays a nipple or a thousand nipples pass unnoticed on the catwalks nevertheless on the morning after her

and aware that while the bustle was being lampooned in the press mill s essay was being debated in the drawing rooms of europe and the americas westwood set out to make connections and to amuse mill of course also wrote on the subjection of women the tract which inspired the suffragettes he was more concerned with lack of property rights and domestic slavery than with corsets but fashion historians and feminist theorists have taken the corset and the crinoline as symbols for woman the non citizen the non person it was westwood who deconstructed that concept perhaps not totally

chance to say what we think about this latest stage in the hunt for particles that might illuminate the dawn of time so calculating my own contribution at about pounds 1 a year say a fiver for the family i flew to geneva to ask the head boson hunter what the payback was professor christopher llewellyn smith is a 51 year old theoretical physicist and cross country blue from oxford who became director general of cern in january he has a rapid precise manner not without humour and the faintly mid atlantic speech of the globe trotting academic he did not try to blind me with science choke me with muons gluons and quarks of colour charm and spin nor dazzle me with the infinitely large and infinitesimally small quantities his profession trades in so endeavouring to look my most alert i asked what will the higgs boson do for the taxpayer it is one very very major step in understanding the way the universe is put together he replied if you ask why anyone should be interested i think there are three parts to the answer first the subject is justified as the pursuit of pure knowledge i mean it s part of our culture he quoted a remark of the first director of fermilab who asked by a us congressional committee what the lab contributed to the defence of the nation replied nothing but it makes it worth defending it s part of mankind s history to be curious about how things work the professor added we re trying to find out at the deepest level what matter is made of why the universe is the way it is and not some other way his second argument was not surprisingly about direct and indirect spin off but he did not labour it the discovery of new fundamental laws of physics usually had important practical applications such as the discovery of the electron however that was getting harder to be sure of the further physics moved away from everyday experience so i don t think you can justify the expenditure on those grounds technical development was another kind of spin off for example the collision detectors pioneered by georges charpak of cern and for which he won a nobel prize in 1992 were used for medical imaging accelerators were employed for cancer therapy that s not the reason you do it but it gives some return and you should subtract it from the price i always say it s a bit like subsidising the theatre in london it brings in tourists but that s not the reason you subsidise theatre his third justification was education flagship projects attracted schoolchildren to science even if they ended up in engineering rather than cosmology while graduate students acquired valuable if expensive training at cern but i said the search for knowledge is the real reason it is the real reason i absolutely agree with that for some people the scale of the endeavour alone may be sufficient justification for spending the money the large hadron collider will be inserted into the biggest of cern s tunnels a racetrack several miles longer than the circle line of the london underground where it takes a man six hours to walk round the protons will whip round the circuit 11 000 times a second their path is so precisely aligned that even the daily gravitational pull of the moon has to be adjusted for to get them to fly in a circular path requires six tonnes of magnetic force every metre the debris of the collisions including perhaps the higgs boson will be detected by machines three storeys high in a microcosm of what was going on a fraction of a billionth of a second after the big bang which began the universe the higgs particle was postulated years ago by prof peter higgs of edinburgh university to explain why some particles are massive some massless llewellyn smith said it would help us understand why some forces of nature operate over vast distances others over minute distances and why matter is clumped as it is this research can tell us why the universe is arranged with islands of stars called galaxies why it has this architecture i think these are pretty interesting questions and if you do not find it there must be some mechanism if it s not the higgs we don t know what it is but we re going to discover something else instead which we haven t been clever enough to imagine but what about the cost i asked can you not see a point at which politicians will stop being interested i would say that convincing politicans is not so hard to a certain extent the hardest people to persuade are people in other fields of science because they are well jealous is the right word i guess it s difficult for people doing biology who need only a few thousand pounds a tiny fraction of what is going into cern so you get the argument why not do biology it s cheaper than physics but by the same argument why not do theology it s cheaper than biology there s a rather nice quote from a french boulevardiste one of whose characters asks why he should pay 15 francs for an umbrella when he can have a beer for two sous i thought of the us decision to cancel its dollars 10bn superconducting super collider in texas which would have been three times the length of cern s scientific advances were quite cheap in the past i said can we justify our thirst for knowledge indefinitely well that s our job in particle physics we have kept the cost down the budget of cern in real terms is less than it was 20 years ago despite the fact that the number of physicists who work here is five times bigger the sfr2 23bn material cost of the large hadron collider will not involve more than about sfr500m of new money the bulk will come out of cern s existing budget currently sfr900m a year as its other experiments wind down the two new detectors costing sfr350m each may be financed out of university research budgets people sometimes say it s like the opera and should be subsidised at the same level i think it s more than that because scientific knowledge is cumulative it s more like the composition of an opera than the performance if you like the discoveries made in the 19th century are still driving today s electrical industry for example and those in the 30s are driving semiconductors you may be able to appeal to politicians or to national or european pride i said but won t taxpayers protest if they can t understand what you re up to that s why i think we have a big obligation to explain what we re doing for a grand reason and a pragmatic reason the grand reason is that we d like other people to share in the pleasure we get in the things we re doing and if it is a contribution to culture then presumably we can all share it the pragmatic reason obviously is if we can t explain then obviously we re going to lose the support of course i said i m impressed you can look at the state of the universe some fraction of a billionth of a second after the big bang but i d pay a lot more to know what happened a fraction before in a sense the big bang is infinitely far away in terms of its energy density in time it s a finite way away but we never will really get there the energy at which one could directly test the theories that put all the forces together is still a factor of about a million billion away in terms of energy it s an interesting question what is in science and what isn t i think to paraphrase st augustine the most profound question that human beings can ask is why is there something rather than nothing now that question it seems to me is beyond the scope of science and probably will always be though there are scientists who think not on the other hand the question we re asking in particle physics is given that there is something rather than nothing why is it what it is rather than something else and that question i think we may be able to answer would it be better for you if the results are a shock better than getting the predicted answer yes it s paradoxes that show there s a real question there so when you find the higgs boson it s going to be both a triumph and an anti climax in a sense to find something different would be more interesting yes that s true if they find the boson do you get a nobel prize the professor laughed certainly not probably mr higgs gets a nobel prize well for my fiver i hope he does\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4030", "title": "ft 12 mar 94 what kind of ghoul am i dominic lawson casts a sceptical eye on the press and cromwell street", "body":

the scenes outside 25 cromwell street gloucester as over a period of days the remains of nine female bodies have been disinterred and brought out in boxes you would think from the comments of journalists that the behaviour of local sightseers was worse than that of whoever put the bodies there frederick west a former resident of 25 cromwell street has been charged with murder paul callan

the ghoul watch as a daily sickening sight he added to his list of sickos the man who now owns the scaffolding covered no 25 for charging pounds 450 for television crews to clamber up and pounds 60 for fleet street photographers well this is indeed all very shocking i imagine we should take it as read that the daily express s photographer was far too noble and sensitive a spirit to pay his pounds 60 and provide a picture of what his own newspaper tastefully calls the house of death and i imagine that the editor of the daily express was most calm and understanding when his star photographer explained why it would be unethical and let us use the word ghoulish to pay pounds 60 to the owner of number 25 i also wonder what the newspapers would call the owner if he had not charged them for their pictures helpful perhaps certainly not sick the point naturally is that the owners of local properties can make big money from facilitating ghoulish pictures only if fleet street wants to publish them the main distinguishing characteristic of the members of the cromwell street ghoul watch is that unlike most of the tabloid readership they live close enough to the scene of the crimes to see it for themselves they do not need to cough up 32p for a copy of the daily express to see the photograph which accompanied callan s article a shocked looking police officer

said oh supremely funny it is a pity miss lee that women can only chortle at male pain and suffering because the problem is growing globally fiddlesticks so tell me this why do women live longer than men it is a question farrell asks the answer is upsetting quoting from us experience and statistics he says that in 1920 women lived one year longer than men today women live seven years longer life expectancy for white females is 79 for black females 74 for white males 72 and for black males 65 power he says is the ability to control one s life death tends to reduce control life expectancy is the bottom line the ratio of our life s stresses to our life s rewards it gets worse blacks die earlier than whites from 12 of the 15 leading causes of death but men die earlier than women from all 15 causes they include heart disease accidents pneumonia and influenza diabetes mellitus suicide chronic liver disease and cirrhosis kidney inflammation aids murder in industrialised societies says farrell early deaths are caused more by diseases triggered by stress which breaks down the immune system than in non industrialised ones it is principally stress that is killing men so much sooner than women compared with other diseases heart attack has now become the no 1 killer of women but men are still far more vulnerable to death from this cause than women before the age of 65 men still die from heart attack at the rate of almost 3 1 compared with women almost three quarters of women who die of heart attack are 75 or older but by then the average white male has been dead three years men lose out all round in the us 83 per cent of the homeless are male as are 90 per cent of deaths from aids and 94 per cent of the prison population 99 99 per cent of the 58 183 names on the vietnam veterans memorial in washington dc are names of men there is a huge amount of data in the myth of male power plus a great deal of plucky interpretation farrell shatters every assumption about masculinity you have ever heard what he has to say is searingly non pc raw and challenging farrell says he does not want to dismantle feminism he just wants us to recognise that in different ways men too have been oppressed and damaged by gender role playing miss lee imagine the uproar if tonight s tv bulletins reported that women were dying seven years earlier than men and that women had been

mouthwatering financial projections it used as bait to attract the top clubs to its breakaway league but saatchi and then fynn were spurned as contracts and jobs were handed out the marketing strategy

deviated from fynn s blueprint the two insist they are not just insiders but fans too guest supports leicester fynn newcastle the proof lies in the rest of the book much of which reads as if it was largely written on a particularly angry night in the pub notably the tedious second hand fan rants against former england manager graham taylor which begin and end the book fynn s blueprint is a marketing man s plan for football the best way to sell the sport is to organise a league in which matches are scarce and every one is an event a contest between glamorous teams with national profiles to do this the fa must shrink the top division to exclude clubs with local profiles these must maximise their income by playing in regional divisions which multiply local derbies fynn argues that a successful national team helps sell the game at all levels by happy chance his plan for the league is also good for the national team reducing the number of club matches cuts wear and tear on players for fynn big clubs are good smaller clubs are bad fynn attacks the tv arrangements in the uk because in the bulk of satellite free households children will be deprived of the chance to support the big glamorous clubs and must instead become fans of the first division clubs they see on itv the book laments the fall of liverpool victims of the system and praises ac milan owned by silvio berlusconi

the fa s director of coaching broke in we already have a chief executive there he pointed at a rather uncomfortable looking graham kelly chief executive of the fa kelly said nothing and the opportunity was gone rather than keep the league under fa control kelly let rick parry an accountant become chief executive with the league granted independence it fell under the political control of ken bates chairman of chelsea champion of the middle sized club and the man who had promoted the return to a 22 club first division bates says fynn does not believe football matches should be scarce he believes in a marginal costing system since a club s costs are largely fixed more games mean more profit a bigger league and more cup competitions are therefore good things this view is shared by the middle sized clubs who form the bulk of the top english division bates political objective was to ensure these clubs had equal power in the premier league after the league was set up bates crowed david dein vice chairman of arsenal was so over the moon at getting his little premier league and couldn t understand why ken bates was so supportive we got a few things in there he is only now begining to realise what hit him one club one vote no committees so you have no permanent chance to be in the corridors of power bates also set the agenda for the television deal that followed fynn thinks this was a marketing disaster the football weekend spread over three days all the tiddlers guaranteed live matches the big clubs largely restricted to satellite the league says fynn could have negotiated a much better deal but the decision to opt for bskyb was not purely financial bates and his mates were prepared to accept a slightly smaller pie so long as they kept their hands on the cake slice bates commands an army of 12 to 14 middle sized clubs each with one vote in the 22 team premier league i asked fynn how he could overcome bates i intend to persuade him that chelsea are one of the big clubs he said but fynn can hardly perform the same trick with coventry or wimbledon to persuade them to do as raith rovers have done in scotland and vote for a smaller premier league knowing

krupp been able to become one of the richest men in the world having been convicted of the exploitation of slave labour and how could the nazis have acted without any economic logic in pursuit of their programme it is evident that the present generation in western europe at least finds the story incomprehensible except in the sense that it is known to have happened there is a suggestion that schindler s list gains impact from events in bosnia but the truth is probably the other way round in eastern europe the position is murkier the communists concealed the reality of the final solution by turning it into a tale of communist heroism in the anti fascist struggle today those societies are having to come to terms with problems that were ignored or rejected thus in the czech republic

a sympathetic light compared with the poles slowo has it in for schindler himself he was a spy in poland before the war and he saved only those who were rich a charge which must be absurd as the victims had already been robbed the film critic of rzeczpospolita wondered why it had been left to hollywood to produce the definitive film had one to be perhaps at a distance physically withdrawn

schindler s list in eastern europe particularly who will side with the perpetrators rather than the victims but the question remains why it should have taken so long for the events to make such an

me standing there wrapped in so many layers including two pairs of gloves that only my eyes were visible and still i could not stop shivering quickly she pulled me inside and soon i was sitting in front of a fire sampling some of the many exotic dishes siberian cuisine has to offer galina spread a lavish table which included home made goose soup pyelmyeni similar to italian ravioli but without the tomato sauce and black bread before bringing out some elk meat and a bottle of throat searing vodka one shot of this and soon you ll be walking around without gloves galina said with a wink as she

lured into treacherous wilds from which there may be no escape the forest looks very beautiful but it is also very dangerous said galina if you were to go inside it would be almost impossible to find your way out because to an inexperienced eye each path looks exactly the same your chances of survival would be very slim you would either die from cold and hunger or you would be devoured by wild animals there are many novel ways to quench your thirst for adventure which are quite harmless one is the banya po chornomu or black bath the siberian sauna a unique experience which siberians believe can relieve almost anything that ails you from bronchitis to a bad heart it s a feeling you won t forget said tatiana novikova a local entrepreneur of the sauna s effects both on psyche and body

sauna but the curative effect is ensured only after the final step after emerging from the sauna dripping wet siberians often take a roll in the snow in the buff being a modest lot we omitted that bit after the sauna i decided to return to my hotel and relax before dinner but there was a complication i could not recall the name of my hotel so i called galina who had made the reservation for me this is rather embarrassing i said but can you tell me the name of my hotel it doesn t have a name she said finally i found it it took half an hour i was beginning to suspect it had no address either i asked the clerk if it really had no name surprised at my question the clerk an old woman replied yes it s true the hotel was what is known as a vedomstvennaya gostinitsa literally a bureaucratic hotel

reservations are made by the employee s nachalnik boss a call from such a highly placed personage and a room is assured the management has no right to refuse on my second day at the hotel the clerk informed me that a woman had just arrived and was staying in my room since i was expecting a friend from moscow i was sure it must be her i bounded up the stairs and rapped on the door tanya it s me just a minute when the door opened i found myself face to face with a stout matron in her mid 50s who regarded me severely we stood motionless excuse me i ventured i think i have the wrong room i checked the number on the door no 8 my room so who was this woman she told me that her name was yelena and that she had come to work at the factory affiliated to the hotel i asked the clerk if there was anything to be done about this distressing situation the answer was negative all i do is take orders she explained i returned to my room don t worry i won t bother you a bit said my new friend who

the north sea and the kattegat the beginnings of the baltic skagen has a name in english a somehow threatening word the skaw certainly the area was a danger to sailors once the skaw has claimed many ships on its sands skagen is no longer threatening and remote but it was its remoteness 100 years ago that attracted a group of painters they came to what was a tiny fishing village in order to escape the stultifying formality of copenhagen s salons starting in the 1870s many nordic painters decamped there each summer forming a sort of artists colony where they would paint and make merry the skagen painters are known particularly for their treatment of light any visitor to skagen will discover that the light has a startling clarity and brightness a combination of clear sea air and sunlight reflected off the two seas and vast expanses of sand summer days are long that far north skagen is level with inverness and there is a magical moment each evening at about 10pm called l heure bleue when the light dissolves into a blue haze between night and day the most famous picture produced by the skagen painters is summer evening on the south beach at skagen two women in long white dresses are walking on the strand the folds in the sand are lit by late evening sunlight and their dresses appear almost illuminated behind them the sea and sky are an indistinguishable blue it was painted 100 years ago by p s kroyer perhaps the finest of the skagen painters i went there in november when there was an un summerly chill and it was dark by 5pm the town of skagen has expanded boats no longer put out from the beach as they do in the paintings but from a large fishing and ferry port the town has spread into small suburbs but the cluster of houses of the old town are charming and pretty with a very nordic neatness most of the old houses are single storey with ochre walls and orange roof tiles their window frames and eaves picked out in white they are couched in tidy gardens behind white picket fences and nearly all have a flag pole on holidays the danes fly long double tapered flags like medieval standards even in november the light is clear and strong i found that it had a curious invigorating effect bestowing the delicious if irrational feeling of confident expectation that i normally associate with the onset of spring i had prepared myself for melancholy instead there was a spring in my step i could see why painters liked skagen so much kroyer s summer evening hangs in the skagen museum which tells the story of the artists through their paintings the town itself is central to their work there are scenes of fishermen launching their boats and scenes of home life the artists also painted one another and kroyer was a leader in their bohemian revelries if the artists came to escape copenhagen society the salons soon followed them the railway arrived in 1890 the smart copenhageners built their seaside villas and skagen became a chic place to be the danish royal family built a summer palace and royal families visited from all over europe the town has lost its bohemian feel there are only a few painters now and writers and actors tend to live in private villas but there is a pleasant seaside feel and a number of attractive old hotels the skagen painters never amounted to a school over the 40 years that the town flourished they used widely differing styles and techniques some were realist almost naturalist in their depiction of the fishermen s simple lives others were clearly influenced by the impressionists there are even snatches of dour danish formality in imitation of dutch masters brondums hotel still holds pride of place in skagen there is a pleasant antique air about the dining room and reception rooms they are lined with dark wood panelling and some original paintings still hang on the walls i crept in one afternoon to flee the cold and was working my way through a pot of hot chocolate when three impossibly tall

he congratulated the winner and presented the trophy rathlin is six miles off the north antrim coast and is ulster s only inhabited island having been so since at least the neolithic period 4 000bc to 2 500bc in its earliest history rathlin must have been comparatively prosperous because of a geological accident the neolithic islanders had a thriving export business a plug of molten lava forced its way to the surface millions of years ago and the heat changed or metamorphosed the rock immediately surrounding it known as porcellanite or recrystallised bauxitic lithomarge by geologists the early farmers who had given up hunting to till the land found it just the job for making axes to cut down trees at brockley towards the west end of the island was the axe factory and the blades have been found throughout ireland in scotland and wales and as far away as north kent along with flint arrow heads and scrapers made from nodules taken from the limestone cliffs axe heads and blanks are still quite a common find on the island because it is only 16 miles from the mull of kintyre the scottish lords of the isles the mcdonnells ruled rathlin for many years the english naturally disputed this and bloody clashes often took place but one dispute in the 17th century was settled by argument rather than by the sword it was claimed that rathlin was a parcel of ireland because the nature of its soil neither breeds nor nourishes any living thing venomous the snakeless argument is interesting several centuries earlier it was used to settle a similar dispute over ownership of the isle of man the normans introduced venomous reptiles on a trial basis they lived and as a matter of course the island was unanimously judged to belong to england not ireland what churchill referred to as the most celebrated spider known to history is reputed to have been a rathlin specimen robert the bruce is supposed to have sought sanctuary in a cave only accessible by boat and then only when the tide is

rathlin especially in the breeding season the smell of guano is all pervasive as thousands of guillemots razorbills cormorants shags and species of gull stake out their breeding nooks and jostle on the narrow ledges each summer other visitors go to study or enjoy rare plants such as the pyramidal bugle or swathes of orchids that carpet the unimproved grassland it is also a popular place for divers off rathlin are some of britain s deepest waters and underwater cliffs as well as numerous wrecks including hms drake flagship of the british navy in the first world war torpedoed and sunk in church bay the activity centre on the island has been designed with divers in mind but anyone interested in outdoor activities is welcomed the building is the tithe barn of the former owners of the island the gage family who also used to own the adjacent manor house which is being converted into a 15 bed hotel the money for these developments has come from various government and european union grants and from the rathlin trust set up in 1987 to arrest the island s slow economic decline the trust received a windfall in its first year richard branson landed in the sea near rathlin on july 3 1987 after crossing the atlantic by balloon islander tommy cecil got a line on the floundering balloon the traditional way to carry out salvage at sea instead of claiming the value of the balloon

it this kind of kitchen of course does not come cheap all the cabinet work was specially made and simon stocker s work alone came to about pounds 19 000 then of course there was the replastering the repainting the flooring and the cost of the very expensive state of the art equipment not all the costs can be separated out the builders were also restoring the rest of the house but around pounds 40

therefore worrall thompson felt he might find a kindred spirit who would understand his needs the inspiration for the kitchen came from a little house which was built for queen victoria s children at osborne on the isle of wight he felt the cottage inspired him to think of edwardian shooting lodges cellar kitchens in edwardian london elgar the malvern hills and a host of other traditional english images from these images he designed a kitchen which had the feel of an old kitchen in a country house but was not strictly traditional as a professional chef says wilkinson i knew he was going to be very demanding on the kitchen physically lots of bashing and kneading so i had to give him something strong and unfussy as the front door opens straight into the kitchen it is clearly the most important and emphatic room in the house more important than the sitting room so it was vital that it was welcoming and attractive as well as functional we put a heavy working area around the sinks and appliances down one side and the large scale storage down the other catering sized equipment as with simon stocker s clients worrall thompson insisted on a giant amana fridge freezer and a belfast

adjoining and leading into the kitchen is the dining area from there the living room opens up the whole feel is of a well loved much lived in room the range of cabinets finished in eggshell cream and with heavy rosewood handles is from mark wilkinson s latest range which he calls cooks kitchen having offered us more elaborate decorative options in the past ranging from a taste of provence to the santa fe look and any number of painted finishes mark wilkinson now felt in need of a simpler approach to kitchen design cooks kitchen has the solid feel of an old fashioned edwardian house a kitchen in a real country house its working kitchen atmosphere is reinforced by the surfaces some made from extra thick maple some from stainless steel and a granite inset in giallo veneziano the floor is made of wide stripped pine floorboards on one wall reinforcing wilkinson s imagery from albion england are some decorative murals of english rural life workers in the fields by samantha allkins which are meant to convey the feeling of exuberance and joy in the countryside on the other wall are some primitive animal paintings as well as some peppers and tomatoes as perhaps befits a prime purveyor

more subdued and in the case of kimonos there is a strict code that married women do not wear furisode instead they wear a black kimono embroidered in gold with the family crest visibly presented

wine", "body": "wines like policemen seem to be younger these days but at least there are more of the former and at prices so temptingly cheap that 85 per cent of bottles sold in the uk cost less than pounds 3 50 a wine costing pounds 10 and above looks decidedly more expensive than it did even taking inflation into account this raises the question is it worth buying wines that require time sometimes a long time to develop their special qualities this question currently occupies the minds of growers especially in france which produces some of the best wines but relies on a global market are they worth their prices and time bordeaux s classed and peer growths the red and white grand and premier crus of burgundies the richer rhones and alsace the answer must be subjective for such fine wines can no more be judged objectively on the basis of what the french call qualite prix and the british value for money than can a delicious but expensive restaurant meal or the cost of fashionable clothes it is mainly a matter of resources and how best to spend those available yet there is a strong case for acquiring fine wines they have individual characteristics seductive bouquets and distinctive flavours dry or sweet there is great variety and they provide agreeable opportunities for comparison that can transform a meal the cost range is wide and it is not necessary to pay huge prices to enjoy them they call for companions to share them discuss and even argue about them to open such wines on your own is a sad waste en primeur and futures marketing has been suspended at least temporarily particularly for clarets and this is no bad thing partly because of inflation and recession but also because of misjudgment of a volatile market about the only recent claret vintage that could be re sold profitably and that only with careful timing was 1982 but these upper class wines must be bought early for keeping including the finer white burgundies and moselles and rhines times are past when top growers and merchants could afford to hold stock over many years interest rates are now too high and capital available must be employed for the next vintage to be bought there is a good case for buying such wines as soon as they are available in bottle from your preferred retail merchant which has made its own selection at various price levels if possible they should be marketed in six bottle lots as well as cases of course older vintages may be bought at auction but although the salerooms do their best to ensure the wines offered are in good condition you cannot always be sure moreover the particular wines you want may not be all that easy to come by indeed if german or alsace almost impossible there are those who ask why with modern techniques development of these fine wines cannot be speeded up do we have to wait up to 10 years before opening a classed growth claret and not much less for a superior red burgundy the answers mostly are no and yes respectively most wines even the lesser varieties are drunk too young that goes for good champagne too one impediment to keeping wine over a period is lack of suitable domestic accommodation it should be held in dark vibration free conditions with equable temperatures generally the risk is heat rather than cold which at worst may slightly delay maturation however most private merchants who sell the kinds of wines discussed here provide temperature controlled reserves currently at a rent of about pounds 4 to pounds 5 a year including vat but as jancis robinson pointed out in a recent article guaranteed individual identification must be assured those who take special pleasure in drinking fine probably at least relatively expensive wines though quality does not always go with price may be accused of wine snobbery no doubt this exists but for most enthusiasts it is a collecting hobby and one to be shared with others wine drinking like this is an innocent pleasure the best ratio of drinkers per bottle in my view is four and the maximum six for enough should be available for glasses to be refreshed often a wine may develop in the glass provided that there are no post prandial car drivers present such rationing at a leisurely meal may allow three or four different wines properly of ascending quality and age from the same region to find their way on to the table\n"}, {"id":

these restaurants is not too good for the same reason when we lunched there one weekday only one other table was occupied in a room that could seat 70 nevertheless a seven piece cuban band was warming up and they greeted us with huge smiles and waves the waitress also delighted to see us handed over a large red menu in spanish and english with about 30 items on it no sooner had we sat down and chosen our fare than the waitress said that unfortunately there was no gas for the kitchen stoves and all the cooked items were off would we like a sandwich instead we had no option even though we already knew that the range of sandwiches on offer in cuba is limited to ham and cheese or cheese and ham the band comprised three guitars a double bass bongo drums maracas andolave and a singer who announced traditional cuban song before each number they played with all their heart and soul and within minutes i had forgotten the unpleasant smell of oil from the wells on the shore the cloudy weather and that i was eating another ham and cheese sandwich suddenly i started enjoying the meal in cuba live music is not just an integral part of every meal but also almost the best value on any

than any meal in the restaurants of hotels such as the nacional in havana or the melia in varadero where so little respect is paid to cuban culinary tradition that you could close your eyes and

paladares became instantly popular with one man reputedly clearing more than dollars 1 000 a week the hotels retaliated unfortunately not by raising standards but by complaining to the government

in the magisterial school you listen and take notes in the experimental you prepare dishes under the supervision of a chef to some extent the form the course takes appears to be dictated by the dominant pedagogical ideas of the country in question so it is that france and italy are magisterial because that is how their schools work while in northern europe there is a tendency to let pupils discover things for themselves the best courses combine the two systems personally i prefer more weight to be given to the experimental side i also like the teaching to be based on instilling principles rather than individual recipes if a course succeeds only in teaching a clutch of recipes it is a little like trying to learn a language from a phrase book what a cook requires is a structural foundation which can be adapted to a wider spectrum of uses the cookery school at the gritti palace hotel in venice has been going for the best part of two decades now the courses take up

the gritti palace a former ducal residence which has been the city s most luxurious hotel for a century or so the courses taught by the gritti s friuli born chef celestino giacomello are in the purest magisterial school a maximum of 20 pupils gather in front of the chef and his assistant while he cooks about half the pupils were italians for the rest a simultaneous translation was given in american english on my course last year all the pupils were serious grown up people with a confirmed passion for food they included a german hobby cook a hungarian woman married to an american and living in padua a japanese would be pastry chef the wife of a new york food broker an elderly russian aristocrat who lived nearby on the grand canal the above mentioned italians and a clutch of swedes including an eminent doctor cum biochemist whose insight into the biochemical and nutritional aspects of what we were eating was a course in itself our theme was herbs or as our interpreter would say urbs in the course of the week we learned recipes involving chervil wild celery citron which is really a fruit red and green chives tarragon oregano dill coriander which giacomello thought an aphrodisiac rhubarb the juice of which was blended with parmigiano reggiano cheese to make a crust for gnocchi root and leaves of horseradish majoram giacomello the queen of herbs nettles which the chef used to make a rich veloute a world away from the soup beloved of irish peasants mint artichoke stems hyssop melissa and fresh angelica leaves every day for five days the chef prepared a three course meal with a side dish this was served up as our lunch in the afternoon further courses examined the growing of herbs table arts and venetian glass flower arranging and a tour of unknown venice i played truant after lunch preferring to pound the marble pavements on my own it seemed to me that the afternoon classes would be better arranged at 6pm when the lovely light had begun to fade i was disappointed that we did not have a chance to practise any of these recipes the one opportunity for audience participation came with the forming of the potato gnocchi for those who had been seduced by the frankly american concept of the mediterranean diet giacomello s cooking used too much cream butter and sugar this worried me less only the poorest parts of italy eat the mediterranean diet and only the poorest people in them the rich citizens of puglia cram as much butter cream and sugar into their gullets as they can i was sadder that the cooking was not sufficiently venetian but one of

the whole waihirere maori group to britain to sing and dance for her at the albert hall then after joining them in two maori numbers kiri sang them climb every mountain after listening awkwardly to

decca will shortly release it on cd cassette and video the most interesting thing about being there live in fact was to compare the actual kiri to the magnified projection of her on screen it proved impossible not to keep turning to the projection because kiri kept addressing the camera those dark eyes are stunning but they would hardly have registered on us mere paying mortals in the albert hall

glowing from deep within it has changed remarkably little since the first time i heard it 21 years ago when she was the offstage priestess in aida i had never i thought heard anything more beautiful the main thing that has changed is the way she projects it it used a voice that made you positively glad to be in the higher recesses of covent garden for you felt its impact all the more amazedly far away up there these days however it doesn t beam out with that kind of address and on thursday kiri was mainly addressing the microphones as the evening progressed and as she moved via rodgers and hammerstein and kurt weill to lloyd webber she sang with the aid of more and more amplification in terms of audience effect this paid off in the first half the house had received her pretty and careful accounts of items from the classic rep with only the merest spattering of applause later however kiri the crossover artist voice flooding through the speakers eyes so gorgeously twinkling into

more pre packaged than patti lupone s true kiri would not be our kiri were she not an icon of popular culture as well as of opera she would be merely te kanawa still as i marvel again at that voice i

current and is the subject of this review paolozzi hasn t and isn t those two shows are distinct in themselves yet to take the one without the other is to miss a great deal for they complement each other to a remarkable degree the one at annely juda is beautifully chosen and succinct setting the retrospective context and the one at kenwood celebrates the latest and continuing creative engagement taken together the surprise they offer is the realisation that caro is rather less the unrepentant formalist and radical influence than we might have supposed it remains true that through his association with the the american david smith in the years around 1960 he alone of his generation brought to england and indeed to europe a formal abstraction that was consciously empty of human reference or association here were elements presented just for themselves cut bolted and welded together in well judged arrangements the space clear and open the form self evident the human contact only that which we have with physical objects in the everyday world the raw physical presence of these things as they appeared in the early 1960s and the stringency of their presentation were wonderfully new stimulating and refreshing if it now seems somewhat ironic that it should have been this phase in his work that shot caro into international stardom the irony as we may now see at anneley juda lies only in the fact that that phase was so short lived what we see so clearly is that caro has been working his way back to the figure or at least to the anthropomorphic inference of the figure ever since the work of the 1950s with which the juda show begins is directly figurative albeit the consciously simple and primitive figuration of such earth mother fetishes as the willendorf venus caro had but lately been assistant to henry moore a distinguished club that in it its time has included bernard meadows and phillip king to move on to the kenwood show is to turn if not full circle at least to spiral back close to the spirit of those early years and not just in the open reference to ancient gods and heroes but in formal terms here in the orangery at kenwood on their symbolic pedestals and thrones sit the totemic presences of gods greeks and trojans and we are at once back to the sculpture of the younger generation of the 1940s and 50s to the welded and symbolic totems of reg butler and in particular to the precarious monoliths and stele of william turnbull and of course the fiercer presences of eduardo paolozzi caro in propria persona stands with

these new modelled elements of terracotta which supply the symbolic character of the heroic protagonists set into or on their matrices of steel and wood is to discover caro happily and unselfconsciously playing the same formal games that engaged him totally 30 years ago but now subsumed within the narrative whole the working of the clay itself takes him back full 40 years to the modelled figures of the 1950s the homeric narrative is given by john spurling in the excellent catalogue who takes us through the roster of the olympian and older gods charting their allegiances and

his instrument seems capable of all the expressive inflections of a human voice for max bruch he goes into full blooded romantic mode just as required and masur treats the orchestral part with enough stern dignity to disguise the fact that this is a fairly bland period piece by contrast dutoit s responsibility in bell s prokofiev is to realise as vividly as possible the bizarre colours of the scores the better to set off the wicked solo role he and his montreal band and the sound engineers do that to memorable effect indeed dutoit and bell find such richly suggestive depths in the second concerto as to confound the received opinion that it is obviously the lesser work in the first concerto bell is equal to every virtuoso demand there is less devilry in his playing than in some famous

palumbo is modest shy reticent not perhaps the obvious qualities required to be the mouthpiece for the arts the pressure point on the government to secure the highest possible levels of subsidy but palumbo is typically dogged in his assessment of his achievements when i was selected i was not even on the original list no one wanted the job but there were plenty of candidates to be my successor the succession was actually quite predictable former arts minister and sotheby s chairman lord gowrie takes on the role on april 1 he should sail in calm waters says palumbo well aware of the storms that have lashed over him especially in the time consuming bureaucratic re organisation of the council but if the operational hassles are in the past with a compromise reached between the strategic role of the council and grass roots devolution to the regional arts boards gowrie will still confront the key problem which made palumbo s last year so frustrating a lack of government cash for the arts unless he did a deal before taking on the job gowrie must soon tackle some life and death crises at leading arts companies in particular among the nation s orchestras i feel bitterly disappointed that we were not given a stand still grant for this year says palumbo for four years he suffered the upheaval of institutional change with five successive ministers responsible for the arts including david mellor twice having a different view on structures from the out and out devolution of tim renton to the all power to me approach of mellor but while this was exhausting and kept palumbo at the council five days a week as against the odd afternoon put in by his predecessor lord rees mogg it was unimportant when compared with the increases in grant that palumbo and his ministers achieved in real terms the council got a 12 per cent uplift in subsidy in the four years until march 1994 this is palumbo s tangible contribution to the arts but from april the council must make do with a 1 6 per cent cut the first in its history taken with the furore over his rationalisation plan for the london orchestras the reduction in grant has blighted palumbo s last months and given an unfairly melancholic tinge to his stewardship i am not a resigner but i did think about it the record of the arts in terms of their cost effectiveness is such that they did not deserve to be cut for months after last november s announcement palumbo did not speak to peter brooke the secretary for national heritage they have now made up but the breach probably put paid to palumbo s chance of taking a leading role in seeing through his brightest idea the millennium fund he does not blame brooke for the reduction in grant there were powerful forces in the treasury like michael portillo anxious to settle scores with david mellor who had used his friendship with john major to favour the arts whatever the cause palumbo is genuinely distressed he is less upset about the mess over the orchestras when his plan to form a super orchestra by merging the lpo and the philharmonia floundered on press criticism the opposition of the musicians and lack of confidence inside the council he thinks that the future lies in backing fewer companies with more cash and that the orchestral issue will come back to haunt gowrie the rows over money and the orchestras did not provoke his decision to resign after just one term he says he made that decision three months into the job when its time consuming nature became apparent as the inheritor of his father s property empire palumbo had never been unduly stretched he collected the rents and as a devoted admirer of modern architecture dreamed of building a skyscraper designed by mies van der rohe in the heart of the city of london prince charles scotched that one so when the unexpected call came from margaret thatcher palumbo threw himself whole heartedly into the arts council i ve been out every night for five years he says i ve only seen my wife at the theatre or a concert and not been able to talk to her until one in the morning i have three young children i want to spend more time with them he also wants to complete the development of his site at 1 the poultry although this time with a building designed by sir james stirling also roundly condemned by prince charles until the rows of the last year palumbo had built up some modest successes at the council i was told by a senior civil servant when i took on the job that it was best to concentrate on three or four things to do a little well rather than a lot badly so he naturally started an architectural unit he launched arts 2000 which encourages each year a different part of the country to sponsor an arts form in the run up to the millennium he backed the lottery when it became apparent that this was the only possible source of funding for his millennium projects he had his disappointments notably a pet project the arts foundation which got off to a shaky start and a much touted national strategy document which was dismissed as trite but in the main it was solid unsensational progress palumbo acknowledged that ministers have the right to decide how the arts are delivered to the consumer hence all the organisational changes but they do not have the right to tell us how to spend the money by quiet diplomacy supporting the government in public palumbo kept the council independent and afloat he feels the more let down by ministers because he played their game palumbo is not sanguine about the immediate future but he is diplomatic if grey gowrie can t get more money for the arts then nobody can he thinks the philistines are at the gates and that the performing arts will be the first to suffer peter brooke may be a believer but there are forces in the government with no appreciation of the arts or the urban landscape it will not be his problem at 59 he leaves with very little baggage his best memories are the opening concert at the birmingham symphony hall with rattle the cbso and mahler i was in tears the whole time and the grass roots projects he so assiduously attended a travelling actor and electrician in dorset encouraging villagers to act out plays a visual arts bus visiting the scottish islands his main energies will now be devoted to his first major property development when he will quickly discover that despite five years as

is a brilliant reappraisal of charlotte bronte s life work and the flow between the two born in 1816 charlotte was motherless by the age of five and packed off to a grim charity boarding school at eight one of her early memories was watching her sister maria die of starvation and physical abuse at the hands of a sadistic teacher recreated as the terrifying miss scatchard in jane eyre the

her publisher george smith also became fraught smith was the model for charming graham bretton in villette 1854 but when charlotte realised his shallowness she wrote him out of the third volume in

for good and ill roger scruton s aim is to introduce us to modern philosophy thus conceived he accordingly explains the nature and purpose of discussion in all its main areas the theory of knowledge logic metaphysics ethics the philosophy of language and much besides starting from rene descartes in the 17th century and bringing us up to date with contemporary debates scruton is a masterly writer his book is a paradigm of lucidity written with a crisp elegance that proves by example the justice of his attack on the jargon and obscurantism which infects much present day philosophy and prevents its wider appreciation a study of philosophy scruton says is a study of arguments and ideas the questions that generate them have a particular character they are abstract in that they concern the most general kinds or categories of things and they are ultimate in that they concern the fundamental reasons and causes of things for example the question why did she fall relates to a particular concrete event why do things fall although more general is still a scientific not a philosophical question what kind of thing is a fall inviting the answer an event and therefore a discussion of whether events are basic constituents of the universe is an entirely general question and shows what kind of understanding philosophy seeks the ultimacy point arises from our need for explanations if b is the explanation for a and if b is in turn explained by c we will hope that there is some terminus d or even z which gives the final explanation for a because if the chain of reasons or causes continues ad infinitum we will have no explanation for a after all can the ultimate grounds of anything even of the world as a whole be discovered philosophy tries to find out another defining feature of philosophy is its quest for truth not all human endeavour aims at truth some aims at convenience some at persuasion some trades in fictions but philosophy is the endeavour to find out how things really are the sciences try to do this in their own particular spheres but philosophy attempts the overview in the hope of devising a framework for understanding ourselves and the world scruton systematically tackles the abstract and ultimate questions which have most exercised philosophers from the 17th century until now his discussion is based on introductory lectures delivered at birkbeck college in the university of london and is therefore aimed at beginners the result is bracing entertaining and informative anyone wishing to learn about philosophy will find it an excellent place to start there are however caveats scruton is notorious for holding disagreeable right wing views which would not matter if he could stop himself making irrelevant allusions to them with neither explanation nor justification but he cannot so resist for example in the middle of describing logical positivism s verification theory he suddenly and without further discussion remarks that it is part of the culture of repudiation whereby central europe threw away its inheritance and committed moral suicide no opportunity for a dig at the left or modernism is missed and although the result is often enough amusing it also injects too polemical and unargued a note into what is meant to be an introduction to the enterprise of reason itself for which dispassion is an ideal there are also odd mistakes bishop berkeley did not deny the existence of the physical world as scruton claims thereby perpetuating an old misunderstanding nor is empiricism a metaphysical theory that is a theory about reality it is an epistemological theory that is a theory about the nature and sources of knowledge but when scruton is not grinding axes or hurrying too fast he is a highly readable guide especially praiseworthy are his chapters on aesthetics and ethics and his robust criticism of aspects of contemporary french thought scruton sees philosophy as an integral part of general education caveats aside his book marvellously shows why that is right\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4065", "title": "ft 12 mar 94 books life and times of a paper tiger the self appointed voice of britain s jewish community", "body":

supporting the terrorist gangs running amok in british occupied palestine the jewish chronicle s directors drew the line at his hailing various atrocities as jewish resistance operations a very different kind of editor perhaps its best ever was william frankel who wrote in 1974 it is today beyond doubt that the palestinians have developed a real sense of identity they form an intrinsic part of the jigsaw puzzle of middle east politics and they cannot be ignored or wished into silence mostly however the newspaper s editors have accepted the dictum which is attributed by david cesarani in this book to frankel s successor geoffrey paul that a newspaper at least one like the jewish chronicle could not run ahead of its readership crusading for one particular cause which they did not share paul banned his reporters from interviewing representatives of the palestine liberation organisation on the grounds that a majority of our readers would misinterpret our intentions that approach would have found favour with the jewish chronicle s directors who in announcing the dismissal of ivan greenberg laid down the main lines of the paper s policy as moderate zionist in respect to palestine orthodox as regards the jewish religion strictly loyal in relation to hmg at times the paper s zionism was so moderate as to be almost indiscernible when theodore herzl announced the convening of a congress to found the zionist organisation the chronicle wailed that the very notion of an international congress was an insult to the patriotism of jews and liable to give rise to groundless insinuations that jews are now confessedly unpatriotic strict loyalty to hmg was at delicate moments interpreted so assiduously as to make cringing seem positively daring the most venomous anti semites when advocating anti jewish immigration legislation at the beginning of this century could not have outdone the jewish chronicle s categorisation of wretched newcomers from eastern europe as the mediaevalised overflow of the russia and romanian ghettos its jocularly expressed bafflement as to why these magnetic poles are attracted to our shores and its advocacy of repatriation based on the belief that men such as these should be returned to their native places such views were supported by letters from readers which expressed fear of competition from lowly paid foreign jews it is indeed the comfortably off who have generally been most at home with the paper the upwardly striving were guided by property advertisements in its columns to move house to those posh neighbourhoods of golders green edgware and their like which were the preferred locations for what cesarani calls the galloping suburbanisation of london jewry although in 1938 the chronicle expressed the view that in order that ostentatious affluence should not provoke anti semitism it might be a good or a bad thing if jews were to ration if they could their representation in the professions by 1985 readership surveys says cesarani showed that 48 per cent of jc readers were in social classes a and b although only 17 per cent of the total british adult population normally fell into these categories the terminal age of education was considerably higher than the national average and the percentage of home ownership at 87 per cent was far in excess of nationwide trends no wonder that when the paper did poke its head above the parapet to bemoan anti semitism its particular concerns included exclusion of jews from certain golf clubs and quotas against jews seeking admission to public schools in this admirably researched if somewhat gracelessly written volume cesarani points out that its readership profile makes the jewish chronicle a highly attractive medium for advertisers indeed each week the

"hedging has been blamed for a lot recently but i do not feel the blame has gone far enough in 1989 i made an investment now i have lost the lot it has cost me pounds 600 and five years of my time in 1989 i planted two long yew hedges the yews came through a yorkshire king of garden centre stocking who sourced them as he put it in belgium they arrived strong bushy and far from cheap they went in 2ft apart in a staggered line a year earlier however i had begun with another line of smaller and cheaper yews bought in transit from gloucestershire s batsford garden centre in the gardens of batsford park the manager did warn me that these yews were small and had just arrived from cornwall so having a few belgian spares i used these in 1989 to thicken up the 1988 line during the summer one of the 1988 intake turned bronze not green and i blamed the drought and academic pressure on the hosing schedule in 1990 eight more of the batsford batch turned bronze too perhaps they had been dry i thought and the drought was taking a year to show the effect they were not dead though and they were showing some green shoots in 1991 however they were bronze all over this started to bother their big belgian brothers by 1992 most of this hedge was burnished to a height of 2ft and the trouble was spreading at a t junction where a second belgian hedge began previously unscathed and bushing healthily in january 1993 i consulted the experts at the hillier arboretum burn the lot they told me with cheerful confidence first though pack up a rooted specimen and send it to a laboratory i returned from hillier and compromised i took out the totally tanned yews and substituted my next best evergreen osmarea belgian buttresses remained only slightly browned and set thickly with leaves the osmarea grew throughout the summer but the belgian buttresses turned bronze at the t junction the upper growths of their brothers began to look twisty and thinly needled i have an eye for sickness and it told me they were ill i have watched them throughout the winter no one now can complain of drought except for a water authority and my cotswold soil drains quickly it is not waterlogged but nothing has improved and i have just removed the last of the 1988 89 intake i have lost pounds 500 of yew and pounds 100 of labour and preparation when we dug up the plants they were not rooted very widely but there were no visible scars or infections this week i have consulted more experts beginning at the royal horticultural society s wisley headquarters where pippa greenwood in plant pathology is celebrating her promising debut on the bbc s gardeners question time at hillier the experts mentioned phytophthora could they have been right unlikely greenwood told me because the rhs had been pestered by the public with just this problem since 1990 and although it had tested clinically traces of phytophthora turn up only seldomly anyway if you have it bark branches and leaves turn brown not bronze then what i asked her the answer she suggested was cultivation the yews might have been planted badly too dry or perhaps too wet or possibly both probably they were put in too deep so the roots could not find oxygen she said she saw this problem often on yews sent in by members of the rhs i protest i have been taught how to garden i am actually rather good at it you would never catch me planting yews too deeply please do not take it personally she reassured me the rhs met lots of people who were obviously very good gardeners but still could make trifling and common mistakes what about the national trust i asked did it not have a problem with old yew hedges which were showing brown patches halfway up yes she agreed but it could well be rodents it was amazing how squirrels for instance could climb up a hedge and ring its bark at quite a height greenwood will see that diseased specimens are examined if sent to wisley by members of the rhs on greenwood s advice i then rang the forestry commission s david rose at alice holt lodge wrecclesham farnham surrey gu10 4lh while the commission usually contracts its knowledge for a fee rose will be willing to consider investigating yew trees if enough readers write in with evidence of a similar problem first he absolved the national trust rodent at buckland abbey the trust lost an old yew hedge and some younger plantings of yew but the cause was diagnosed as phytophthora which is in rose s view by far the commonest cause of death in yew this of course does not suit my problem i have bronzing not browning and my plants are not actually dead so rose asked what about the cultivation too wet too dry too deep or might it be the climate cold winds and they are cold in the cotswolds or sudden frost ask an expert and you almost believe him but wait the bronzing began on only one plant and spread first to only one batch it took six years yet all the yews face the same wind the same drought and the same old adam in the gardener how can they be the cause at this point i think i trust my common sense i believe that batsford gave the disease to belgium and the others are fighting infection and i think i know where it came from across the channel it infiltrated cornwall on imported eurostock and spread to london with people who buy plants in transit to sell them before you plant a yew hedge be clear that the stock is clean its source reputable and do not plant it too deep meanwhile if you know of trouble write to rose and give details something other than phytophthora is abroad and i refuse to believe

of a journey which took them by truck from tehran through azerbaijan and georgia across the caucasus mountains and through the ukraine to brest in belarus where they were quarantined before continuing to england their arrival is a milestone in the history of the breed the caspian believed extinct was rediscovered almost 30 years ago by louise firouz an american married and settled in iran it was first imported to britain in the early 1970s prince philip the duke of edinburgh was given a stallion and a mare by firouz forming part of the uk s foundation stock for these stylish horses acknowledged now to be one of the oldest breeds in the world and a forerunner of the arab approximately 19 horses were imported from 1971 until the revolution in 1977 stopped exports and dispersed existing stocks in iran their discovery has a fairy tale ring firouz had been searching for mounts for younger pupils at her riding school and discovered a small bay stallion perfectly proportioned in a village on the shores of the caspian sea further sorties uncovered more horses their diminutive fine boned bodies contrasting sharply with the heavier coarser mongolian and turkoman horses of the area the caspians proved perfect school horses popular with parents and pupils encouraging firouz to research and foster the breed by the late 1970s she held a herd of 200 horses only to be dispersed and almost lost in the revolution the second revival of the breed in iran owes much to the chance discovery of a handful of caspians in a barn of more than 1 000 horses being sold off by the revolutionary guard in 1989 the caspian stands between 10 3 and 12 3 hands with an arab type head slender limbs and fine silky coat they are intelligent gentle move with elegance and panache and are equally at home under saddle in harness or on lead rein their disposition makes them ideal children s mounts particularly fond of jumping but they are also extremely successful as driving horses proving themselves genuine all rounders that the whole family can enjoy the uk has approximately 260 registered caspians spread throughout six large studs and numerous smaller operations there are also studs in australasia and the us two of the new arrivals are currently in quarantine in epsom before going to the us to augment the bloodlines of foundation stock meanwhile their companions can

seventeen years later he is one of england s best known blacksmiths and the force behind the move to rediscover wrought iron topp started the campaign for real iron in the early 1980s when he realised that the skills associated with the traditional material of the blacksmith were disappearing the last works producing wrought iron in this country closed in 1984 after that it was a case of running fast to pick up whatever stocks were available said topp a limited amount is being produced at the ironbridge gorge museum but 10 years ago the situation looked bleak in 1980 topp won a pounds 9 000 contract to construct elegant early 18th century style gates and railings at a country house near york for a client who appreciated the difference between the mild steel that was usually supplied and real wrought iron the problem was where to find the wrought iron he heard of a huge stockpile originally the handrail on the south pier at sunderland that was about to be thrown away and dashed to the north east he returned with 15 tons a load that cost him pounds 200 but which laid the foundations of his business in 1980 i moved to north yorkshire from the restoration engineering company i had been managing in derbyshire to try to get away from people constantly dropping in and asking me to mend prams and sledges said topp i managed to buy the former village garage which became my forge plus the house that went with it for pounds 32 000 i was keen to get into some real restoration work though initially i was resigned to making fire irons and mild steel gates masquerading under the misnomer of wrought iron to sell to tourists and local garden centres fortunately the york contract put paid to that through his former contacts in derbyshire and local conservation bodies topp found he had enough restoration work to support his wife and young daughter my main desire was to do forge work said topp from an early age i had been fascinated by iron when i was at school in bolton i used to go and watch the men at the atlas ironworks now reconstructed at ironbridge after gaining a degree in civil engineering at newcastle university topp worked briefly for british waterways where he concentrated on jobs involving 18th and 19th century iron structures he started the derbyshire workshop with a few old school friends but when that diversified in the late 1970s he decided to branch out on his own the original stockpile from sunderland has long gone in its place is a stock of assorted vintages of wrought iron topp lovingly strokes a rusting bar of metal and pronounces it some of the finest produced in the early 18th century for the school of jean tijou he is using some of this to restore a magnificent pair of gates from marston trussell hall in northamptonshire in a contract worth pounds 10 000 this is the sort of work i love said topp the work at that period was so delicate and well proportioned the end of the 18th century brought the introduction of mass produced puddled irons inferior in topp s view to the earlier work made and refined in charcoal fires however for everyday purposes the two are indistinguishable both offer a resistance to rust and corrosion you will not find in steel he said their fibrous nature means they are unsurpassed for ornamental ironwork where there is a lot of fine beaten three dimensional metalwork wrought iron costs about five times as much as mild steel which was introduced in the 1850s in spite of the cost topp has not had a slack period in 14 years he has supplied work to the prime minister s residence at 10 downing street chatsworth house in derbyshire warwick castle and other famous and historic buildings a pounds 10 000 job is not a big contract nowadays topp said in 1992 we turned over pounds 85 000 and made a net profit of pounds 21 000 last year we hit a very big seam of work and i hope the figures will show we doubled that one big job for six tons of wrought iron glazing bars in 19 different sections for a large dublin restoration job was worth almost pounds 80 000 much of the work was more repetitious than i prefer but for that size of job it was worth it topp is midway through a pounds 35 000 contract for decorated wrought iron seaside railings they include buckets and spades and windsurfers for the resort of redcar one disappointment however is the market for cheaper one off items made in mild steel there is intense competition for this sort of work railings produced to a budget in city centres are a typical example i reckon i need to pull in pounds 120 a day per man for that sort of work in order to be profitable but it has been nearer pounds 80 recently my two assistants are self employed so it is important to them that we increase it however the order book for high quality fixed contract wrought iron work is healthy so in 1994 we shall probably concentrate increasingly on that aspect of our work this should help reduce the bank overdraft currently about half our upper limit of pounds 15 000 one of topp s recent innovations is to design and sell small furnaces for blacksmiths to use as adjuncts to their forges these allow smiths to heat several bars at once so

die within seven years of making the loan alternatively if it is not a pet it could be within the pounds 150 000 nil rate band as your son repays the loan this has no inheritance consequences for him it reduces the value to your estate of the right to receive the balance of the principal outstanding if you wish to write off any part of the principal outstanding the waiver must be effected by a deed informal waivers ie by letter are not effective for tax purposes a waiver constitutes a potentially exempt transfer on each occasion one is made if you were to survive for seven years from the date of the transfer then no iht will be payable at all and it would not affect your nil rate band if you were to die within the seven year period then the transfer could fall within the nil rate band

000 each not surprisingly some are worried they might lose their money should i die i have thought of three options although each has flaws 1 to draw up a will the trouble is each time somebody cashes in their unit or invests more money i would need to prepare a new will and have it witnessed 2 to write out ious these would not be ideal though as the value of the portfolio changes from day to day besides which would they have any legal effect 3 to issue certificates in the same way as unit trusts again though i am concerned over the legality question and how exactly to proceed as i understand it family members give you money to invest on their behalf you buy the shares or other investment property in your own name but presumably keep a record of how much each family member contributes in effect therefore you own the shares as trustee for the various family members the shares are not your property although your name might be on the certificates consequently you cannot include in your will any provision for the disposal distribution of the portfolio investment as a will can provide only for the devolution of your own property it appears to me that since what exists here is a trust you should draw up mutually agreed written terms for its operation including what will happen on your death this can be done quite informally so long as the written constitution states clearly the intentions of the investors one suggestion is for the constitution to provide that on your death an appointed person realises the investment assets in your name and that the proceeds be distributed to the family members in proportion to the amounts they have invested any contribution of your own into the portfolio remains your own property nevertheless it can remain part of the trust property with yourself as trustee and your estate as beneficiary the above suggestion deals with this situation reply by barry stillerman of accountant stoy hayward no legal responsibility can be accepted by the

offer some of the best yields available every investor should consider them to prove anyone can acquire them i visited the city branches of several large clearing banks and asked their share dealing services if i could buy and hold a eurobond through them they did not make it easy but the problem seems to be that few people know what a eurobond is let alone how to deal in one bonds are simply a loan from the investor in return for which there is normally a fixed rate of interest and a fixed repayment date in the meantime the loan can be bought and sold in the same manner as shares the most common example is uk government bonds or gilts the prefix euro originated late in the 1950s when eastern european countries transferred large amounts of dollars from american to european banks in 1993 pounds 21bn worth of new issues were launched in sterling alone approximately 10 times as much as non eurobond issues eurobonds trade in bearer form that is the share certificates are like cash and the holder of the bond is assumed to be the owner each certificate has coupons attached representing the interest payments these must be removed and presented for payment with a weekly turnover of more than dollars 100bn it is not practical or safe for each buyer and seller to exchange their certificates in person most stockbrokers overcome this by settling via one of the two main eurobond clearing houses euroclear brussels and cedel luxembourg but there are charges for doing so eurobond dealing and handling charges generally are higher than for gilts but the impact on yields declines with larger orders all bond markets have seen extreme turbulence recently as a result bonds have produced negative returns of up to 8 per cent in 1994 the positive side is that income seekers can

the section 135 pistol at the heads of most expatriate option holders this week the full u turn was completed as what remained of the revenue s concessionary treatment was withdrawn for options exercised on or after april 6 since the letter of the law clearly backs the revenue any attempt to resist a tax demand on option profits will be futile remaining abroad with all your assets might stop

that element of a realised gain caused by inflation since march 1982 the cost of securities acquired after march 31 of that year is indexed by the change in the retail price index from the month of purchase or acquisition to the month of disposal note that the month of purchase is the month of the contract s date not the settlement date calculation of indexation using factors the inland revenue issues a monthly table of indexation factors these apply to the original cost of a holding sold in that month for example its january 1994 table not shown here gave a factor of 0 665 for june 1983 thus if shares bought for pounds 1 000 in june 1983 were sold in january 1994 the calculation needed to work out the indexed cost would be pounds 1 000 pounds 1 000 x 0 665 pounds 665 pounds 1 665 an alternative and simpler indexation tool is provided in table 1 by adding 1 to all the factors published by the revenue the ft allows you to cut the calculation down simply multiply the original cost by the adjusted factor ie 1 665 so pounds 1 000 x 1 665 pounds 1 665 where to find the factors a table of adjusted cgt indexation allowances is published each month usually on the last saturday in the weekend ft these cover allowances for the previous month those for january 1994 were published on february 26 see table 1 calculation of indexation factors the indexation factor is calculated like this take the retail price index rpi in the month of disposal and subtract the rpi in march 1982 or the actual month acquired if later divide the resulting figure by the rpi in march 1982 or the actual month acquired if later here for example is how to work out the factor for the sale of an asset acquired in june 1983 and sold in january 1994 using the rpis from table 2 rpi january 1994 rpi june 1983 rpi june 1983 gives you 141 3 84 8 56 5 84 8 0 66627 rounded to the nearest third decimal place this would give 0 666 the difference between this and the published factor of 0 665 is due to the published rpi figures being themselves rounded calculation of indexation using rpi alternatively you can use the monthly rpis which are produced by the government statistical service and published widely in the financial press each year for instance accountancy magazine produces a complete table of rpis going back to 1915 and this is updated each month in the ft table see table 2 in our example above taking the rpis for june 1983 84 8 and january 1994 141 3 from table 2 the calculation is quite simple the indexed cost original cost x rpi for the month of sale rpi for the month of purchase or pounds 1 000 x 141 3 84 8 pounds 1 666 either method factor or rpi is acceptable to the inland revenue providing it is consistent in other words you must stick to one method all the time a great advantage of using the rpi is that you need only one table of rpis rather than a factor table for each month what happens when the rpi is static or falling if the rpi for the month of disposal is the same or less than the rpi for the month of acquisition or the rpi for march 1982 if acquired pre march 31 1982 then indexation would be nil that is there is no negative indexation if the rpi falls share pooling for stock acquired after april 5 1982 where you add to your existing holding of a security and all your previous purchases have been later than april 5 1982 your total holding of that security is treated as a single asset if you dispose of part of your holding the disposal is treated as a partial disposal ignoring indexation for the moment let us consider a shareholder who invests in the ordinary 10p shares of stakis the scottish based hotel group see table 3 stakis fell on hard times due to rapid and imprudent expansion sometimes into activities unrelated to its main business it even acquired a stockbroking firm robert wigram co in september 1987 the month before the market crashed it took a change of management the disposal of peripheral activities and a one for three rescue rights issue to turn the company round now let us include indexation table 4 shows how 1 the cost of the original holding is indexed from the month of the original purchase to the month of the rights issue 2 the total cost is indexed to the month in which 4 000 shares were sold this is the method that revenue legislation stipulates a re calculation of the indexed cost should be made every time an operative event occurs an operative event is any event which either increases or reduces the cost of a holding this is fine if you are programming the calculation for a computer but not if you are a small private shareholder working it out by hand in this case you can simplify the process by doing the calculation only when a disposal takes place first you either index the original cost to the date of this disposal or if there has been a prior disposal from the holding index the indexed cost of the residual holding at the date of the last disposal to the date of this disposal then you index the cost of each subsequent purchase from the date of acquisition to the date of this disposal in our stakis shareholder example the shareholder has made no previous disposals see table 5 we will deal with the treatment of securities acquired before march 31 1982 in our next article proposed changes to the rules on indexation in his november budget the chancellor announced that for disposals made on or after november 30 the day after the budget indexation would be allowed only to reduce or eliminate a capital gain that is it cannot be used to create or increase a loss in addition as we mentioned last week the indexation of the cost of holdings of negligible value is ruled out for negligible value claims made after november 29 even if the revenue had deemed them to be of negligible value before then these proposals are contained in the finance bill now going through parliament and are not expected to be altered payment for shares by instalment acquisition date if you subscribe for an issue of shares and pay for them by instalments indexation of their cost is calculated as follows 1 for privatisation issues from the date you acquire the shares 2 for other issues a if all instalments are payable within a 12 month period from the date by which the first payment has to be made b if payments are spread over more than 12 months from the date by which each

jeans going up over the next month or so or maybe you would like a bet on the direction of heating costs for garment manufacturers you protest i just want a designer silk waistcoat small sized i believe it will be a good investment and will serve me well for years ah replies the manager we cannot provide such things any more but perhaps you might like to give us some money and let our computerised trading system invest in a wide range of waistcoats including one or two made of silk although to be honest a few probably will fall to pieces you won t be able to handle any of the garments either as we keep them to sell some sight unseen to other traders if you asked the manager why he no longer sold clothes direct to the public he might tell you well it s such a bother people have got to actually make the clothes transport them to us and then we have to hand them physically to customers by trading in all these other things instead we can do everything electronically at the touch of a button and it s much more profitable for us all this might seem rather ridiculous but replace garment and waistcoat with direct shareholding in a small manufacturing company and the comparisons with today s financial markets become more obvious recently i tried to increase my shareholding in a small well managed company only 10 000 shares were available though and it proved impossible to buy any more even though i was willing to pay more than the supposed market price for them it appears that i have become old fashioned over the years i have made respectable profits by investing in small companies that actually made something companies that i saw as having particular strengths and likely to grow the thing is i bought shares only after a certain amount of personal research and investigation now it is the fashion to let others make the investment decisions and increasingly shares in companies are being bought because they happen to be in a particular index the derivatives market too has increased dramatically its influence over the share prices of many companies last year in the uk more than pounds 9bn was poured into unit trusts there are now so many that choosing between them is even more difficult than deciding on an individual company s shares investment trusts also have multiplied at one time many seemed a bargain because their shares stood at a discount to their net asset value but i suspect that many investors who bought these just a few years ago will be surprised if they turn to the ft s share price pages it is amazing how many of these trusts now have a premium rating being valued at more than their assets i have nothing against unit and investment trusts a number have produced an excellent performance more than tripling their investors money over five years equally some have performed very badly turning pounds 1 000 into less than pounds 900 after five years it is examples like these that make me want to continue making my own direct investment decisions in individual companies even when i find a company which i think is undervalued however its share price still can be clobbered by institutional investors switching out of it not because they dislike its management or prospects but because a short term computer program made them do it or because it has been pushed out of an index perhaps by a bubble company that has grown larger because of hype and over expectation even more scary is the increasingly powerful influence on the market of financial derivatives again i have nothing against trading in options and futures particularly when it is used as a hedge to protect exposure to foreign currencies and a variety of commodities but it seems to me that too many people are now treating these markets like casinos for every bank that announces huge profits on its dealings in derivatives someone somewhere must have made correspondingly large losses the amount of money trading on foreign exchange markets world wide each day has been calculated to be considerably more than the value of world trade and in a number of countries exposure to dealings in derivatives does not have to be revealed to regulatory authorities the next stock market crash could well be triggered by dealings in derivatives people making too many wrong bets that a share index will rise or fall or that the price of a currency commodity bonds or a combination of financial instruments will perform in a particular way surely the time is approaching fast when people ought to stand back from these markets and re evaluate where they and their countries are going what future is there for a nation s industry when it is easier for people to bet on a possibility something that cannot even be touched than it is for

fund invests in several funds including property but the managed stock exchange fund excludes property both had below average returns in 1993 although they began to rally early this year alan goodman assistant general manager for marketing says after several years of good stock selections and a favourable bias towards uk investment the managed fund suffered from the effective devaluation of sterling following its withdrawal from the erm exchange rate mechanism in september 1992 moreover from late 1992 and for most of 1993 overseas equities performed better than the uk market the managed fund was underweight in this area compared with other funds several of the society s funds reveal a peak in 1991 92 followed by relative decline the uk equity fund also one of the largest in its sector with pounds 1 745m under management achieved top quartile top 25 per cent results over a rolling five year period but a closer look reveals a peak performance in 1991 followed by below average

"body": "every year the treasury collects a multi million pound bonus from taxpayers who do not make full use of allowances and reliefs to which they are entitled the main areas in which you can reduce your tax bill are income tax everyone has a personal allowance of at least pounds 3 445 for the 1993 94 tax year more for older taxpayers on top of this the first pounds 2 500 is taxed at 20 per cent and the next pounds 21 200 at 25 per cent above this you are in the 40 per cent bracket families should make sure income producing assets are in the right hands to take maximum advantage of allowances and the 20 and 25 per cent rate bands married couples can elect on form 17 obtainable from their local tax office for income from jointly held property to be divided between husband and wife in accordance with their beneficial interests in the property this election is effective only from the date the form is signed however so it is worth thinking about now for 1994 95 a word of warning on gifts to children if a parent puts capital into trust for a child only the first pounds 100 of income is regarded as the child s for tax purposes the rest is treated as that of the parent but if a grandparent puts capital into trust for a grandchild the income is the child s for tax purposes this is also good inheritance tax planning the tax relief on the married couple s allowance pounds 1 720 is worth only 20 per cent in 1994 95 so it will not be worth transferring this to the wife unless the husband s income is below the threshold couples for whom this transfer will be an advantage should get a form 18 from the revenue and return it by april 5 married couples with a joint mortgage have until april 5 to elect for the interest paid in the 1992 93 tax year and thereafter to be allocated between them in whatever proportion they choose normally this is the only way in which you can get tax relief on a second mortgage if they do not make this election the interest is divided equally between them but unlike miras this interest attracts relief at the top marginal rate of tax of the person to whom it is allocated this can make a very considerable difference to a couple where one spouse pays tax at 40 per cent and the other at 20 or 25 per cent if you have had a bank deposit of pounds 50 000 or more which pays interest gross for a number of years it might well be to your advantage to close it and re open it by april 5 your tax assessment for the 1993 94 tax year which you should have paid on january 1 will have been based on the interest credited to your account in 1992 93 if you close your account now your assessment for 1993 94 will instead be based on the interest credited in 1993 94 because of the sharp fall in interest rates over the period you should get a repayment of tax you do however need also to look at your tax assessment for 1992 93 which will be based on the interest credited in 1991 92 if you close your account the revenue could revise the 1992 93 assessment to the amount you actually received in 1992 93 since interest rates generally were lower in 1992 93 than 1991 92 the revenue normally will not seek to revise the 1992 93 assessment but you should look at the facts of your own case before acting the scope for employees to reduce their tax bills is limited it is worth bearing in mind that the tax drops by a third if you drive more than 2 500 business miles in your company car by april 5 if your employer is unwilling to send you on the necessary business trip you could remind him that his own national insurance contribution on your car also goes down by a third if you are considering paying additional voluntary contributions avcs into a pension scheme do so by april 5 if you want tax relief against your income for 1993 94 if however you expect your income to rise considerably in the next tax year and you will pay tax at 40 per cent rather than 25 then it could make sense to defer payment of the avcs until after april 5 the contributions will be invested in the fund for almost as long and they will have enjoyed tax relief at a higher rate contributors to personal pension plans should also look at their position before april 5 this is the last day for paying a premium which is to be treated as paid in the 1992 93 tax year so reducing the tax bill for that year any relief still unused from 1987 88 will no longer be available after that date capital gains tax you will know more after march 26 when you have finished reading the weekend ft series by richard chant and alan sugden but there will be only five working days left in the tax year after then so here are some points for those who want to act now everyone has a tax free cgt allowance of pounds 5 800 for the tax year 1993 94 this cannot be carried forward investors should aim to bed and breakfast ie sell and re purchase shares which are showing gains thus using up the allowance and increasing the cost to be used in future sales transfers of assets between husbands and wives are tax free since cgt is payable at an investor s top marginal rate of income tax it makes sense first to use both spouses allowances of pounds 5 800 and then to route sales through the spouse with the lower rate of tax you should take care to ensure that the paperwork is in order if you are thinking of transferring assets before sale in particular the sale proceeds should not find their way back to the spouse who is supposed to have given them away if you are already over the cgt threshold for 1993 94 and are about to sell an asset with a large gain doing this after april 5 means you will defer payment of the tax until december 1 1995 also if you are over the threshold consider if you can reduce your bill by making a negligible value claim before april 5 inheritance tax this is levied at 40 per cent on a person s estate on death although the first pounds 150 000 is exempt you can reduce your estate by giving away assets providing you live seven years afterwards no iht will be due on them you can also give away up to pounds 3 000 each tax year and the gift will be entirely tax free if you do not use up this allowance in a year the unused part is carried forward for another year in addition you can give away up to pounds 250 each year to as many people as you like thus if you did not make any gifts in 1992 93 you can give away up to pounds 6 000 by april 5 this year this will be ignored for iht purposes bear in mind however that cgt is payable on gifts of portfolio investments to your children value added tax unless you are planning to move house pre pay domestic electricity and gas bills before the 8 per cent vat is introduced on april 1 investments you can put up to pounds 9 000 each tax year into personal equity plans pounds 6 000 into a general pep and pounds 3 000 into a single company pep income and capital gains are tax free so the only charges are those of the fund manager other tax free products include national savings certificates the 41st issue pays 5 40 per cent which is equivalent to 9 per cent gross for a 40 per cent taxpayer remember if you were not sent a tax return for 1992 93 but had a new source of gross income or a capital gain on which tax is due make sure to tell the revenue by april 5 to avoid a penalty\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4083", "title": "ft 12 mar 94 finance and the family putting people first cripps harries hall seventh in a series on fee based advisers", "body": "lawyers may not be everyone s idea of sympathetic independent financial advisers but david lough once a merchant banker argues that solicitor firms can bring special qualities to investment and financial management lough s own experience appears to support this view in 1988 he set up the finance and investment services division of cripps harries hall a solicitor based in tunbridge wells kent it now has 21 staff 600 investment clients and pounds 76m under managment lough a client of cripps harries hall before he joined the staff says he saw an opening for a firm that could draw together all the strands of a person s affairs his division which provides pension mortgage and insurance services as well as investment and cash management is staffed entirely by financial and investment specialists none is a solicitor according to lough the operation aims at stewardship of a family s money and he feels solicitor firms are ideal for providing this they start from the right ethical platform having always disclosed commissions they handle client money but their regulatory armour is all but bullet proof and they can integrate a client s legal and tax affairs with his financial planning lough went to cripps harries hall from county natwest where he was managing director throughout the deregulation dramas of the 1986 big bang i didn t really enjoy it that much he says although it was a real crucible of learning but at the end of the day you were dealing with basis points for institutions it is more fun dealing with things that matter for people his private clients are a diverse bunch they include investment bankers and the directors of top 100 companies as well as retired bank managers and teachers there is no minimum investment requirement although if people have less than around pounds 50 000 in investable assets they are advised to opt for a series of four or five investment trusts he says we explain that they are paying the investment trusts to manage the assets for them charges normally are on a fixed scale three quarters of the clients opt for discretionary investment management the fee for which is 0 6 per cent a year on the first pounds 400 000 0 25 per cent on the next pounds 400 000 and 0 125 per cent after that minimum charge is pounds 595 each client has an individual portfolio even for personal equity plans when they receive their twice yearly valuations the performance achieved on their behalf is measured against a composite benchmark which is matched to their investment aims lough is cautious about investing he says we are not right for someone who wants trading based service and who wants to be in and out of the account our emphasis is very much on the long term and our clients quite like the fact that we are naturally prudent conservative investment managers if they had an enormous risk appetite they probably wouldn t come to us unsurprisingly therefore the investment management successes have been with solid companies such as baa marks and spencer and shell house builder berkeley also has produced wonderful results for chh clients with large portfolios on the other hand british steel has proved a disappointment lough says i have come to the conclusion that it is just too political an industry he adds private clients judge you by a subtle series of values such as whether you are efficient in your administration whether you have taken the trouble to understand their position and whether staff are helpful on the telephone you can lose your client s trust very quickly if you make mistakes they will think you are a shoddy operation and they are quite right he encourages clients to visit tunbridge wells for a first meeting so they can see the set up and the people this is very much a team approach by no means everyone arrives with their affairs in order though sometimes detective work is needed to establish a new client s capital gains tax position one even arrived with a suitcase stuffed with share certificates he had no idea what they were worth says lough actually it was more than pounds 500 000 cripps harries hall cites provision of comprehensive financial and investment services as a major point of difference between itself and many other solicitor firms but lough believes the time is coming when solicitors generally will have to decide whether they are willing for stockbrokers to take over a client s investment affairs or whether they are going to go full tilt at it themselves so far it has been firms in large provincial towns and cities with big retired populations that have acted there are undoubted signs that the role of solicitor firms as investment managers for private clients has revived in recent years indeed lough chairs the association of solicitor investment managers which was founded in july 1993 as a forum for such firms to date the association s directory lists 17 members which collectively manage more than pounds 600m of private client money apparently others are queueing to join lough says we formed the association because we felt there was very little public awareness of solicitors investment and financial services for clients the ethical base of solicitor firms has always been excellent and we believe that the firms which belong to the

tracks it against the ft se 100 index of corporate giants very broadly small companies tend to flourish when the economy is expanding but are more vulnerable than large ones when recession bites not all individual small companies exemplify this pattern though either long term or short term early this decade they seemed to be dying like flies and even when the index is doing well there will always be enormous variations between the performance of individual companies reasons for the growth in profits and share prices also vary what investors like most because it will give them long term outperformance are small companies with a simple profitable formula that can provide above average growth for several years peter lynch who built up fidelity s best known mutual fund magellan called such shares tenbaggers those with the potential to give tenfold returns but in the recent smaller company boom many of the strongest performances have come from companies which nearly went bust but survived to fight another day the first of our individual company charts shows what happened to an acquisitive little textile company called hartstone which looked like a real growth story at least a fivebagger but ultimately came unstuck the second chart shows how jewellery company signet the former ratners clawed its way back from the brink conclusion although small companies as a whole have done better historically than larger ones there are periods in which they do worse and many individual companies fail to conform to the norm so it is helpful to buy at the right time and essential to invest in the right companies is this a good time to buy most pundits reckon small companies are unlikely to produce such strong relative share price performance this year as last the shares are starting to look very highly priced already when measured against their actual earnings although earnings should grow strongly one argument from enthusiasts is that uk markets are repeating the pattern already set by us markets and us smaller companies have outperformed by some 40 per cent since they bottomed late in 1990 so uk smaller companies which have outperformed by a paltry 30 per cent since they touched bottom late in 1992 must have further potential well maybe an alternative argument is that even if british smaller companies have nearly run out of puff there is still scope in smaller companies overseas european economic recovery is relatively immature on this analysis the american small company boom is pretty mature the british one ripe but with a bit further to go and the european one just on the launching pad what are the snags anyone who owned smaller company shares late in 1987 will not need reminding that smaller companies can be illiquid this innocuous sounding word means you cannot always buy when you want to or not without moving the price against yourself and you cannot always sell when you want to at any price in addition the gap between buying and selling prices the spread could be much wider than it would be with a large company this means your shares must rise further before you can genuinely notch up a profit some fund managers are already finding it hard to buy as many shares as they want in companies they like but others argue that the stream of attractive new issues is alleviating this problem how should you invest your can either invest directly in smaller company shares or buy a smaller company unit or investment trust if you are an experienced knowledgeable and sensible investor smaller company shares are one area where the private individual is not necessarily at a disadvantage to the professionals many readers may prefer to use a unit or investment trust although often these have done substantially worse than the index

behind a booming bond market when bond prices rose so did share prices this made sense higher bond prices meant lower long term interest rates lower rates were both good for the struggling economy because they cut the cost of capital for companies and loans for consumers and good for share prices because they made stocks look more attractive relative to fixed income securities however now that the bulls have deserted bonds and long term interest rates are speedily rising the stock market is struggling to unhitch its wagon from a panicking bond market this is not to say that the stock market should ignore the bond market s decline since october long term interest rates as measured by the yield on the benchmark 30 year government bond have risen more than 100 basis points from just below 5 8 per cent to 6 95 per cent stock market investors are right to be worried by this sharp increase in rates because higher rates threaten the economy s health by raising the cost of borrowing for corporations and consumers they also make equities look potentially less attractive compared to other assets just as important the stock market should be concerned if the bond market s losses have been prompted by signs of steadily rising inflation inflation as the economists keep repeating is the enemy of financial markets but and it is a big but short and medium term interest rates even with the recent increases in bond yields remain low by historical standards also little evidence exists that the recent growth in us economic activity has been stoking the inflationary fires if anything the long term outlook for inflation is surprisingly bright unfortunately bond market investors are allowing their hearts to rule their heads and investors in stocks rattled by the big increase in long term interest rates are proving equally fickle this week the markets were so shaky that two unsubstantiated rumours about the whitewater affair contributed to a sharp and panicky decline in bond prices first a washington dc political newsletter reported congressional gossip that the body of vince foster the aide to president clinton who committed suicide last year had been moved from an apartment to the virginia park where it was later discovered second a newswire service reported that hillary clinton had invested money in a hedge fund that later benefited from shorting us pharmaceutical stocks this report attracted a lot of attention because the president s wife has been playing a key role in drawing up plans for a reform of the country s healthcare system plans that have hit the share prices of big drug companies there was little evidence at the time to back up either story but the financial markets are so nervous that both reports combined with revelations about the allegedly improper actions of white house staff over investigations into the whitewater matter badly spooked already jumpy bond market investors or at least that was what traders were saying on thursday when the 30 year bond fell 1 1 4 points the sharp drop in bond prices inevitably sparked a sell off in the stock market amid the smokescreen sent up by the whitewater affair the rumours of skulduggery in the white house and the growing fears justified or otherwise of returning inflation there is an important truth the financial markets after three years of unprecedented prosperity are

a sharply rising stock market but outperform on the way down but in a stock market driven by falling interest rates they have not been performing to historical patterns one way to track them is via kleinwort benson s index of the 80 largest convertible issues by uk companies last year the cosi 80 gave a total return of 25 per cent nearly identical to that of the footsie but below the 34 5 per cent of the fta long gilt index since then convertibles have held up well under the downward pressure on markets from the beginning of this year to thursday s close the cosi 80 which has a market capitalisation of some pounds 14bn had a total return of minus 1 1 per cent while the footsie s was minus 4 8 per cent and the long gilt index s was minus 6 7 per cent the convertibles yield spreads over gilts have narrowed sharply but this outperformance has left convertibles looking over valued moreover rising dividends on ordinary stock are making the convertibles look less attractive kleinwort still believes however there are some worth buying typically they would be issued by a company with good fundamental prospects and would offer a superior yield to the ordinary stock crucially they must be available for only a reasonable premium over the ordinary shares two current examples are british airways 9 75 per cent 2005 and tomkins 6 25 per cent 2013 convertibles

the underlying performance were ahead by 10 per cent from pounds 338m to pounds 373m birkin presenting his last results as executive chairman said the prices of most metals appeared to have stopped

average base metals prices are unlikely to differ much this year from 1993 in spite of some signs of economic recovery around the world there would certainly not be enough of a rise in demand to reverse the flood of metal into stocks he said the extent of world oversupply of copper and aluminium the two base metals that most affect rtz s performance is illustrated by yesterday s london metal exchange warehouse stock figures aluminium stands at a record 2 589 575 tonnes and copper at 537 475 tonnes well off the january peak but still high most analysts who watch base metals prices agree with crowson that 1994 is unlikely to prove exciting lawrence eagles of futures brokers gni is forecasting several lacklustre years before stocks are drawn down crowson s projection is that prices this year will be liable to fluctuate over a fairly wide range before any clear tends become established but they should not drop back to the lows reached last november since then prices have risen about 20 per cent the rise was triggered and even sustained by investors acting largely on technical analysis of chart patterns crowson said nick moore of ord minnett an affiliate of the jardine fleming group says this is consistent with speculators moving in ahead of evidence of recovery he also points out that in the past three peak periods for base metals in 1974 1980 and 1988 prices rose 150 per cent ahead of the low but the next peak could be three years away kleinwort benson last week said that for the first time all 15 prices in its commodity index were rising at the same time leo doyle of kleinwort says the index was not designed to say anything about the future direction of commodity prices it was an indicator of world economic activity however if the underlying strength of the world economy is improving faster than other estimates indicate then base metal stocks could be drawn down faster than many believe whatever happens in the markets says moore rtz is in a terrific

guardians of financial rectitude are setting out deliberately to turn britain into a nation of speculators it is just a by product of their plans for a re vamped stock market settlement system the bank s proposals for an electronic system known as crest have the needs of large institutional investors in mind private investors are an afterthought at best and the new system whatever its overall merits will be generally bad for individuals their biggest gripe has been that crest virtually forces them to put their shares into nominee accounts which deprive them of some of their traditional shareholders rights such as getting company documents and going to meetings far less attention has been paid to the imminent introduction of margin trading investing in the stock market using borrowed money this has long been common practice in the us and in futures markets worldwide but until now the uk stock market has worked on a peculiar system all deals done by an individual investor within a certain account period usually a fortnight are netted out and settled six working days after the end of that period in july the account system will be replaced by something called rolling settlement under which each deal will be settled a certain number of days after the actual bargain is struck initially 10 but eventually five or even three there will not be time for investors to settle up within the deadline they will have two choices either they keep substantial funds with their broker or they open a margin account this means either that you put up a certain proportion of the cash you will need for a share purchase and borrow the rest from your broker or that you pledge some of your existing shares to your broker as security against new purchases and borrow the rest of the purchase costs if for example you had a portfolio worth pounds 50 000 you might be able to borrow pounds 25 000 for new purchases but if the price of your shares fell your margin could fall below the agreed level and you would find your broker making a margin call in other words asking you to top up your deposit here is a lucid exposition of how margin trading can oil the wheels of the stock market mechanism in the stock market the buyer of securities on margin gets full title to his property in an unconditional sale but he rids himself of the most grievous burden of ownership that of putting up the purchase price by leaving his securities with his broker as collateral for the loan that paid for them the buyer gets the full benefit of any increase in value the price of the securities goes up but the loan that bought them does not the machinery by which wall street separates the opportunity to speculate from the unwanted returns and burdens of ownership is ingenious precise and almost beautiful banks supply funds to brokers brokers to customers and the collateral goes back to banks in a smooth and all but automatic flow margins are effortlessly calculated and watched it all sounds very efficient but what is a touch worrying is that the quotation comes from professor jk galbraith s classic book the great crash 1929 it describes in pitiless detail how margin trading eased the wheels of the wall street boom and prepared the way for the bust when share prices started to fall margin calls volleyed forth but all too often went unanswered because the investors quite rapidly ran out of real money wall street encountered the problem of negative equity long before british home owners of course margin trading does not always have such tragic consequences the system flourishes in new york today without spreading routine financial devastation but in the united states margin requirements are controlled tightly by the central bank as yet both the bank of england and the london stock exchange seem to be shrugging off all responsibility for margins let us not exaggerate reckless trading on margins is likely to be a minority problem but it is ironic that the bank is partly responsible for introducing a potentially explosive system into this country tax collectors have long ranked with pharisees and sinners as legitimate popular hate objects and avoiding paying unnecessary tax is almost a sport among the investing classes early spring is the peak season for this taxation phobia can become dangerous however if investors start choosing investments purely

laws but in one western city it is a reality the city is el paso in west texas on the us mexico border where us authorities have instituted unprecedented measures to staunch a flow of illegal immigration recently i went riding with the us border patrol to see what operation hold the line and opposition to it is all about i drove into el paso from the east along the rio grande river as a natural feature separating two countries the rio grande is unimpressive it is so narrow and shallow in parts that the name wetback traditionally applied to illegal mexican immigrants who swam the river hardly seemed to apply on several isolated stretches near the santa elena canyon i was able to wade back and forth to mexico without even getting my knees wet but the river has an ally in the land that surrounds it the chihuahua desert forms some of the most inhospitable country on the continent only the most determined and well organised illegals try to make their way to american cities on the northern side of this vast empty tract of scrub and cactus none the less even here there are foreign nationals mexicans for the most part but also other latin americans and immigrants from as ar away as east asia who make their way across the border with the hired help of mexican coyotes skilled guides with local knowledge their ruses are many illegals have been known to walk backwards for miles across the desert to confuse their trackers or even to attach horseshoes to wooden blocks on their feet and the stakes can be high not long ago a group of chinese illegals paid dollars 30 000 apiece for the privilege of being smuggled across the chihuahua desert into the us they did not make it from time to time as i drove through the desert i came across the highway check points and the green and white off road vehicles of the us border patrol with slightly more than 4 000 men the patrol is the first line of defence against illegal immigration into the us el paso the patrol headquarters for this section of the frontier took me by surprise it has long ceased to be the romantic cowboy town of western legend today it is a busy military commercial and industrial centre the largest on the frontier between houston and san diego in el paso i watched spooky looking stealth bombers fly over the city from the runways of fort bliss got caught in horrific freeway traffic jams on interstate 10 and breathed desert air perfumed by a thick brown layer of factory smog a graceless booming nose to the grindstone sort of place el paso was not a city i found attractive but attraction is a relative matter directly opposite el paso a mere three minute walk over the santa fe international bridge lies the city of juarez the fourth largest in mexico separated by nothing more than a few feet of shallow and muddy rio grande water two worlds meet head on one is wealthy productive and full of opportunity the other is poor corrupt underdeveloped and overcrowded seen from the other side of the river el paso is a land of plenty hey you wanna wake up in time for work i was standing on a broken sidewalk at the bottom of benito juarez avenue in downtown juarez and talking to

of ill lit drinking places and souvenir shops off track betting offices and strip joints taco bars and dance halls on the sidewalk you can buy anything from stolen windscreen wipers to young girls frank was hawking cheap watches and alarm clocks from a cardboard tray frank had returned to juarez after years as an illegal farm worker in fresno california life was bad there for illegals he told me but the money was good he came back because he was falling apart he was drinking and smoking too much marijuana and had become mixed up in hard drugs and gang life i almost died now i live clean go to church every day and sell clocks for people to wake up frank is an exception no matter how difficult life may be for mexican illegals they are thought to number millions few voluntarily return to the grinding poverty of home nor has their presence in the past at least been entirely unwelcome in the us for decades american business and agricultural interests especially in southern california encouraged illegal immigration because cheap mexican labour meant bigger profits from time to time the us government cracked down on illegal immigration but there was a tacit acceptance that what was good for business was good for america and a blind eye was turned order a meal in a los angeles restaurant today and the chances still are that the salad you eat was grown transported prepared and served by illegal labour but it is no longer easy to enter the us american recession unemployment rocketing health and education costs growing crime and social problems and sheer weight of numbers has brought a dramatic hardening of attitude one of the toughest reactions is operation hold the line we used to cross the river to work in el paso and come back to juarez to sleep frank told me hell i knew guys who used to come home for lunch now we have people here from central mexico with nothing to eat and nowhere to stay sleeping on cardboard and waiting days or weeks for a chance to sneak over most often they don t get it operation hold the line begun last september was a radical change of strategy for the el paso border patrol in the past the 650 patrol agents in the sector ran mobile patrols throughout their territory 160 miles of border and 125 000 square miles of rough uninhabited desert frontierland adjacent to it although the patrol was arresting between 800 and 1 300 mexicans a day it estimated 10 times that number about 10 000 people a day were regularly getting through the vast majority were crossing through the city itself today el paso is no longer an open corridor hold the line adopts tactics of permanent concentration where crossings are greatest there is now one patrol agent stationed every 400 yards from the ysleta spanish mission on the border in east el paso to sunland park in the west a distance of 20 miles with such a blockade in force 24 hours a day seven days a week illegal crossings are down by 90 per cent originally called operation blockade and accompanied by a proposal to build an impenetrable steel fence between el paso and juarez the strategy initially brought vigorous protest from the mexican government us civil rights groups and the locally powerful catholic church to some it was a berlin wall i got in touch with monsignor remundo pena the bishop of el paso to find out why hold the line had caused such a stir what i asked the bishop who began his career working with illegal mexican farm labourers in the lower rio grande valley was wrong with the border patrol enforcing the law nothing he replied what needed looking into was the law itself for the bishop hold the line is an historical economic and political contradiction until last century el paso and much of the south western us was mexican territory today 70 per cent of the city s us population is hispanic for many in the region the border is an illogical inconvenience work too unites rather than separates el paso and juarez for decades the maquiladora or twin plant system has linked the cities more than 70 corporations including honeywell general motors siemens toshiba and sony manufacture goods in el paso but have them cheaply assembled in juarez above all though it is the alliances of the future that make hold the line a non sequitur with the signing last year of nafta the north american free trade agreement the two cities on the border have become in theory at least a symbol of a strong new partnership how asked the bishop can you promote juarez el paso as a single international city of free trade welcome your new business partner but then slam the door on his family i went out that evening to see how that exclusion process worked in the border patrol processing centre at the foot of the santa fe bridge i watched patrolmen working under bright fluorescent lights they were searching newly apprehended illegals questioning and registering them and placing them in holding cells prior to their return to mexico business was slow a few teenagers came through a prostitute a couple of children caught shoplifting but bright light is not the patrolman s natural element his real work takes place in the dark of the night when the vast

breathing was difficult down beside the rio grande seeing anything was more difficult still here in the city the river is little more than a shallow channel of water contained between concrete walls and the border zone is a dim half lit world an urban no man s land of abandoned waste ground barricaded no go streets empty railway yards fenced off warehouses chained gates prohibited access zones and long stretches of chain link fences riddled with holes it is eerie and slightly ominous as we drove along the concrete banks of the river at regular intervals we passed parked vehicles in which uniformed men sat hour after hour eyes glued to binoculars and infra red night sights the only sound being the buzz and crackle of two way radios men sitting by roadside fires women walking along the highway boys loitering in the shadows nothing on the other side of the river went unnoticed after years on the job moon told me patrolmen develop a sixth sense for who and who is not waiting to make a dash over the border we drove further moon showed me marshalling yards where prior to hold the line up to 80 mexicans at a time would rush the border and freight trains pulling out of el paso i saw school grounds where young illegals can blend into a student population in seconds along the river i was shown places where during high summer water boatmen landed their passengers in the full view of

deprivation the absence of the mad march annual publicity grabbing exercise by the chancellor which has been transferred to november we are left glumly to ponder how badly demand in the economy will be affected when the impact of the pre programmed tax rises begins to be felt next month a talk to the confedration of british industry this week by stephen dorrell one of the junior treasury ministers on his review of savings and the flow of funds through the economy was not exactly a substitute for a meaty red dispatch box exercise nevertheless there were some fascinating pointers to the way the treasury views its functions and how politics and economics become tangled in a thoughtful talk dorrell could not resist remarks such as savings are the life blood of the economy well the political spin is nearly always that savings are virtuous but consumption is self indulgent and shortsighted the irony is that the treasury in its macroeconomic rather than microeconomic mode is gambling that a drop in savings next year will offset the extra taxes it is loading on the economy if consumers insist on tightening their belts rather than raiding their piggy banks the growth rate of the economy will falter the higher tax revenues forecast for 1994 95 will fail to materialise and interest rates may have to go up to maintain confidence in sterling and in the government s ability to finance its deficit smoothly the idea that savings might be not so much the life blood as the cholesterol of the economy was a foundation of keynesian theories in the 1920s and 1930s the private sector might decide to save too much to maintain full employment if there were too many misers their depressing influence might need to be offset by some public sector spendthrifts spend now tax later trouble was politicians tended to forget the second part of the formula or at any rate they replaced it with the modified version inflate later the private sector of the economy has been saving on a massive scale recently in an attempt to reduce the debt burden it acquired in the late 1980s the personal sector has been in massive financial surplus for a couple of years now and the company sector turned itself around during 1993 so that in the third quarter of last year the combined private sector surplus was running at about 6 per cent of gdp the public sector was forced to dissave in order to prevent an economic collapse hence the nervousness about its efforts to pass part of the parcel back again by reducing the deficit the personal savings ratio jumped from 7 2 per cent in 1989 to 12 6 per cent in 1992 and it is generally forecast to fall back below 10 per cent by next year at this level it would be slightly below the international norm but well above the notoriously low us figure of about 4 per cent although the definitions vary of course politicians do not say that people should save less they do not eliminate tax shelters such as peps and indeed there is some logic in that because these are long term incentives and should not be imperilled by temporary problems cutting short term interest rates is the most common and effective means of hitting savings again this is not expressed directly and other reasons for changes tend to be given relative to the inflation rate however short term interest rates are not particularly low and ironically the cut in mortgage interest relief coming next month will have the opposite effect of discouraging borrowing and thus of boosting the saving ratio but although saving remains comparatively high the really odd thing about the british economy is that consumption is high too we are living beyond our means as a nation with an external current account deficit of pounds 10bn or more government consumption is offsetting private sector frugality the way back to external balance is through more saving and investment but that would cause a collapse in government revenues stand by for a tricky balancing act the dorrell review however appears to be mainly about the microeconomic aspects of savings and investment flows whether pension funds are too greedy for dividends for instance or whether clearing banks are too obsessed by the availability of collateral when financing small companies perhaps the government is struggling to develop some kind of philosophy after norman lamont suddenly imposed what amounted to an extra tax on company dividends in the final spring budget 12 months ago the reasoning behind that has never been explained except to the extent that the move raised a significant amount of new tax revenue there may be an attempt to dump some thatcherite baggage the thatcher government originally had some clear dogmatic objectives such as levelling various playing fields including those relating to the taxes on dividends and debt and the taxes on personal income and capital gains market forces were to be supreme but eventually the clarity became buried beneath an accretion of peps tessas and business expansion schemes stephen dorrell appeared to offer little in the way of principles just a series of questions about whether maybe the uk should seek to channel resources to a british recreation of the german mittelstand or medium sized manufacturers and whether british companies pay out too much in dividends was that the reason perhaps for the dividend tax changes a year ago but we are going over some very old ground albeit beloved by meddlesome politicians changing the tax allowances on the titanic will not provide much protection against icebergs or even medium sized u boats enough of reviews roll on the next budget\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4100", "title": "ft 12 mar 94 testing time for wind farms", "body": "the wind energy industry has been warned it must overcome

are about as open as before all that can be said for certain is that whitbread will not use the stakes acquired from whitbread investment co last year to make full bids for the regional brewers the most obvious explanation is that whitbread does not want to acquire new estates of varying quality when that would require offsetting sales of pubs under the government s competition rules indeed the rules make it so complicated for big brewers to buy small ones that the strategic imperative must be considerable to make it worthwhile consolidation may yet come though as a result of regional brewers buying each other once the whitbread sale has been absorbed selective bid premiums could appear in their shares unlike the big brewers the regionals have scope to expand their pub estates that would lessen their dependence on a particular regional economy add efficiency to food operations and give them the clout to negotiate larger discounts from outside beer suppliers there may be less room for brewing even large regionals lack the scale to develop their brands nationally which is why opportunities may yet arise for whitbread in brewing it has shown with boddington what it can do

and now you want a proper garden don t let sentiment take over gardens", "body": "retirement offers every keen gardener the sweetest of dreams no longer will gardening be slotted into weekends and those summer evenings when for a marvel the train is on time retirement opens a prospect of unhurried days and years even so before throwing yourself into an orgy of improvements it is worth taking an unsentimental look at your garden and its surroundings does it really merit your energies for the rest of your gardening days just as a significant proportion of couples decide on reaching retirement that life could be a good deal pleasanter with a new partner the same is true of the garden although it might be painful in the short term parting from your old garden could be vastly better than slogging on with a hopeless case think about the features of your present garden that no amount of time and money will change is it sun less does it lie in a frost pocket year after year frustrating your ambition to send superb apples to the local flower show if it has hungry stony soil or back straining clay does it really deserve more years of struggle but as in the search for a new human partner however it behoves you to be circumspect when choosing a new one otherwise you could end up in a worse plight than before first there is the soil gardeners who are house hunting should insist on making several substantial test digs around the place one probe is not enough because it is sod s law literally that you will dig at the only patch of workable soil light is a trickier factor house hunting in winter can disguise the fact that in the summer umbrageous trees to the south may take most or all of the sun even if that does not concern you horticulturally it could matter very much if basking in a conservatory was part of the plan and if the new house is in a conservation area or if the trees have a local authority protection order you will be prevented from felling them or even pruning them heavily few people recognise that summer house hunting also has drawbacks it is important to think ahead to winter and work out the angles for those months when the sun hangs low otherwise your new garden could overshadowed by surrounding buildings crocuses will never open and the soil will remain cold late into spring if you are house hunting in winter and spring many things may go undetected only the growing season will reveal if the borders are riddled with couch grass bindweed and ground elder that is why the general feel of a garden kempt or unkempt pruned or left wild is so revealing anyone who is not yet a good gardener but means to become so in retirement would do well to take a knowledgeable friend to view the short listed gardens and look for signs of criminal neglect it is unlikely that borders gone wild would put you off buying a lovely property but at least you would know to expect the worst once the most thuggish weeds have run amok through a border and tightened their stranglehold on roses paths and box hedges there is no way you will ever get rid of them without starting again this means hard work lifting plants replacing them if they are inextricably weed bound and using weed killer unless you are absurdly namby pamby and propose to devote years to the job reclaiming a garden from the worst kinds of perennial weeds will be neither cheap nor quick the matter of whether the soil is acid or alkaline is crucial only to gardeners who have a particular passion for certain plant families whatever is growing already in a garden or its surrounds probably will show whether gentians or rhododendrons are to be part of your new gardening life these are deep matters which matter to gardeners alone do not expect estate agents to be any help in tracking down a garden for your golden afternoons even so when i toyed with finding a cottage in the cotswolds last year it was a shock to find how feeble they were awareness of britain s most popular leisure activity has yet to impinge on your average chap with a clip board i was on the books of eight agents not one with software allowing it to specify that i should receive particulars only of gardens above my minimum acceptable size two thirds of particulars gave no indication of the area of garden with a property even more infuriating was that when i rang agents they often had no precise idea of the size of the gardens they were handling rather than take measurements they preferred to suggest you made a time consuming journey to see for yourself my own house in central oxford has an unusually large south facing garden for the area yet when thinking of selling i had to insist on the particulars being reprinted to include the measurements and a brief description of the garden all the same it is worth pondering the crucial matter of how big a garden you want for retirement something larger is tempting finally you might think here is the chance to make a water garden grow alpines in raised beds or plant an orchard but there is the problem of time and time time with a small t simply means not under estimating how busy you could still be even in retirement again the life partner enters into it by now it will be apparent whether he or she is a gardener if not it is hardly tactful to start making a still bigger garden which inevitably would occupy much of your energies when the non gardening spouse s perception of retirement was travelling the world and seeing more of the family then there is the larger question of time good gardeners know it already but novices never do a new garden is a slow business it takes 10 years before an orchard gives a reasonable return four years before old roses start to perform well and the same for a newly planted herbaceous border to start looking like the picture in your mind s eye retirement should usher in two decades or so of vigorous activity but gardeners who are perfectionists by nature have to accept that they make a rod for their own backs if they take on too big a plot as the joints begin to stiffen it is always possible to resort more and more to hired labour but if part of the charm of finishing work was to get away from dealing with personnel problems it is perhaps not the best idea to make them an integral part of your retirement scenario even with a large and challenging garden it is extremely hard to find knowledgeable hard working full time gardeners in sympathy with the owner s own tastes all in all then it might be sensible to be circumspect when hunting for the retirement garden and scaling down not up this need not mean loss of face or less challenging gardening quite the reverse if you start to specialise vic dickson cohen one of the best gardeners in

subsidiary in familial terms it s like having a teenage child living at home and bringing in a large slice of the family income but having no say in the decisions he says the slice of income brought in by girobank has been impressive in 1993 it amounted to pounds 75m of a l s pounds 205m pre tax profits while the previous year it contributed just over half of the pre tax profits of pounds 122 5m indeed the contribution goes beyond the obvious pre tax profits since girobank also pays dividends into the main group accounts in 1992 it accounted for most of the pounds 37 5m income from shares in subsidiaries which was attributed to the society in 1991 it contributed almost pounds 30m in a similar form these were substantial amounts particularly in 1991 when the society was suffering heavy losses on its commercial lending the purchase of girobank from the post office in 1990 for pounds 112m thus looks like a bargain in more ways than one we bought girobank because we felt we needed a current account says mr peter white now group chief executive it was a question then of getting a long term strategy for where we wanted to be in retail financial services having bought girobank we were much more relationship driven in bringing to the fore this greater emphasis on relationship with the customer rather than on product the link with girobank was one of the driving forces behind the group s strategic review the strategy based on advice from gemini consultants was agreed by the a l board in april last year and the process of implementation has continued since though there is still some way to go the first change most customers are likely to notice will be in may when girobank s 1 4m personal customers are moved into a l though they will still be able to use post office facilities and telephone banking services soon after that a new current account the alliance account will be launched as a further stage in the integration process the move will roughly halve girobank s balance sheet as retail savings worth about pounds 1bn are transferred to a l this has the added benefit of giving a l extra liquidity which will stand it in good stead for the recovery of the mortgage market it will also provide greatly enhanced opportunities for cross selling financial products to different groups of customers as the overlap between a l and girobank customers is relatively small mr white sees this as one of the key tasks for the coming months it will take us another year to get complete cross selling he says girobank itself will be left with its fixed assets a small amount of commercial lending and its profitable money transmission operation though mr white insists that no decision has been taken there must be a question of how far the successful cash transmission business high in volume but low in margin will belong in the future within an organisation intended to focus on its relationship with personal customers mr john wriglesworth societies analyst at ubs says that the remaining parts of girobank are now in a state when they could be packaged up the money transmission business could well fetch more than the whole organisation cost a l in 1990 he suggests the role of two other minor subsidiaries is easier to see in a relationship driven a l both a l personal finance the unsecured loan subsidiary and a l estate agency have a rationale within that concept and both are likely to be maintained as separate operations in the drive towards customer relationships and cross selling the greatest question which a l has yet to decide is its strategy for moving into insurance and equity products at present the society acts as a tied agent for scottish amicable a life insurance company we ll know what we want to do within the year mr white says unless a l is out of kilter with the trend elsewhere in the sector the assumption must be that it will probably set up its own life company in order to have greater control of the products it sells mr white argues that the amount of management time and effort devoted to the review over the past couple of years has not really cost the society anything as in his words there s been no mortgage market the cost may have been however in terms of a delay in any ambitions in converting the group into a plc two years ago the society was already being tipped as likely to follow abbey national which converted to plc status in 1989 while those prospects were delayed because of the commercial lending losses mr white s stance now is that there is nothing the society wants to do that it cannot do while retaining its mutual status given that the building societies commission the statutory regulator seems willing to be flexible in its approach his view may well change as competition increases further in both mortgage and savings markets in those circumstances a l would not have the two or three years of good sustainable results behind it that any society would want as a basis for conversion and it may well be that the investment in the strategy will not be reflected fully until the 1995 results at present it looks as though it will be worth the wait\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4134",

were on whitewater and this most distinctive first lady s presumed role at the heart of it hillary s week has seen her portrayed variously as lady macbeth michael millken and joan of arc it is best described in the words of her assailants and defenders on sunday the new york times let loose maureen dowd on hillary last year the clintons knowing ms dowd is a reporting trendsetter sought to charm her and she confessed in print to being charmed not now she clinically dissects the sources of hillary clinton s power beyond the relationship with her president husband and sees them collapsing her

of shredded documents at rose perhaps ordered by her again many of the mood quotes are anonymous but they are hard advisers say no staffer wants to be the first to talk bluntly to mrs clinton because

impossible for a pundit not to have an opinion about hillary some tried to have it every which way ted koppel cerebral host of abc s nightline declared there is no doubt many of those who oppose the

answer anna quindlen the new york times columnist thought the president came perilously close to a little woman defence of his wife her ironical conclusion was this hillary clinton will once more break new ground this time as a presidential adviser spouse in the midst of a political maelstrom it will take a great mind to determine how to play this out luckily we have a great mind in the white house unfortunately she s the one most involved in the mess in this maelstrom not many things are certain any more some now seem irrelevant that for example mrs clinton is a person of exceptional intelligence and qualifications with a long standing interest in the policy issues that drive her husband s administration this may puzzle europeans accustomed to invisible political spouses but until she became such a whitewater target this week most americans were comfortable that her policy wings had not been clipped second and perhaps less well appreciated is that for most of their marriage she

knows much about finance and the family third there is a well established pattern to doing business in small states there will be a dominant local law firm a leading local brokerage and bank and a powerful company or three all of them accustomed to doing business sometimes sweetheart deals with each other and with state politicians the clintons covered most of these connections one way or another and their state prospered relatively under their tutelage on the evidence so far presented an important caveat given all the rumours of smoking guns to come arkansas was no exception to the rule and both clintons seem baffled that they should be thought to have done anything wrong and they do not have the brass nerve of orville faubus the arkansas governor of legend who when asked how he

trying to identify locate and arrest the ira volunteers who still plan murderous attacks while their political masters talk of peace the ira has changed its internal organisation in recent years in a way that makes it more difficult to keep track of its operations and identify its main players the organisation has become more decentralised with individual active unit cells operating autonomously

france is that its tentacles are spreading last month s gangland style assassination of mrs yann piat in the sunny resort of hyeres is the incident that has most shocked the french because she was a woman because she was a udf deputy in the national assembly because she had the courage to campaign openly against corruption and because she left behind a letter pointing the finger of suspicion at several fellow politicians if anything should befall her mr charles pasqua the interior minister who has promised to get to the bottom of the affair sent a top paris policeman and magistrate down to hyeres to head a massive inquiry two local men have been detained but dozens of others have been questioned including some of those in mrs piat s letter such as mr maurice arreckx a senator and president of the var department s conseil general it is this possibility of home grown political involvement in the piat killing that probably most shocks the french but there is a wider international context to her death extending right along france s southern seaboard in perpignan in the west the local procureur prosecutor said recently i would dearly like to put my nose into the activities of a bank and certain businesses based in a newly independent state bordering the eastern pyrenees by which he meant andorra to the east hard by the italian border the city of menton now routinely insists that italians wanting to buy a business or develop real estate produce a certificate from the italian authorities showing they are clean of the mafia this week top french and italian investigators met to exchange information on fighting organised crime they gathered in aix en provence whose procureur general mr claude salavagione warned publicly in january that mafioso penetration is not just in drugs but in all sectors this was indeed the theme of a report last year by a national assembly committee on which mrs piat sat the report urged that france should act before the mafia took deep root on its mainland as it has done in corsica where there have been 11 assassinations this year but it spoke of worrying signs of a growing mafia presence in france citing a few instances of its involvement in casinos in the south east golf clubs in the var and the alpes of haut provence and more generally in real estate perhaps its most disquieting revelation concerned the poor response of banks in france s south east to a 1992 decree requiring them to report suspicions about drug money passing through their vaults to a body within the finance ministry in paris called tracfin since february 1992 tracfin has received about 40 declarations of suspicions a month which is few compared with the thousand which scotland yard processes monthly the report said adding that it was astonished that the share of declarations of suspicions coming from banks in the south east was virtually nil part of this is because of the lack of any formal co operation from monaco only one french city however pins its problems solely on the italian mafia this is menton where the mayor mr jean claude guibal had the effrontery in 1989 to refuse to let an italian company manage the municipal casino we lived through hell says an aide to mr guibal our children were threatened we found crushed birds on our doorsteps and a wheel came unstuck when the mayor was driving his car after a tip off from paris in 1990 that the mafia might try to take by force what it could not by intimidation the mayor ordered the casino surrounded by municipal garbage trucks now the casino has a french manager and the city is calm but the mayor s office say it faces constant pressure from mafia attempts to buy and develop local real estate further west along the cote d azur there are countervailing fiefdoms keeping direct mafia influence at bay this was certainly true of nice while the medecin family reigned in its hotel de ville this long reign came to an end in 1990 when mr jacques medecin fled to uruguay where he is now appealing against an extradition order to face tax and corruption charges back home but though a prison a police station and a tax office were mysteriously bombed in january 1993 the city remains relatively free of the mafia certainly mr jacques peyrat believes so he has no reason to do the nice political establishment any favours he is running as the front national candidate in tomorrow s final round of voting in a nice parliamentary by election against the gaullist mayor mr jean paul barety among the charges levelled against the fn by its opponents corruption does not figure by almost never gaining power the fn to which mrs piat once belonged has never sullied its hands in this way i am certainly calling for a clean sweep in nice mr peyrat says noting allegations by local socialist councillors of impropriety by the mayor s running mate mr bruno miraglia in land dealings mr miraglia denies any wrongdoing but this has nothing to do with the mafia who might have some residences in nice but have never tried to grab power here adds mr peyrat however he sees real estate temptations for all concerned as nice expands growth has certainly brought graft

from the quiet resort described in simenon s 1952 book mon ami maigret it has had three murders and half a dozen bombings in the past two years mrs piat had apparently intended to make opposition on environmental grounds to full scale development of the town s giens peninsula a feature of her campaign for the mairie next year but the var chamber of commerce based in toulon says her assassination is catastrophic for the image of the region to which it has been trying to attract new industry to offset shipbuilding s decline one theory is that mrs piat may have been killed in revenge for her alleged involvement perhaps with rival marseille gangsters in the assassination a year ago in italy of mr jean louis fargette a toulon underworld figure many var politicians turned out for mr fargette s funeral at which the priest said he forgot certain moral values but i know he would never touch drugs or prostitution out of respect for his mother mr fargette figured in mrs piat s 1992 letter as

construction licence but the ministry has told us that the company has 300 partners and they cannot possibly check all of these for mafioso connections of course the company will give us an anti mafia

main function is to find and buy houses and flats at the end of the process the service should have made clear to a client all the pros and cons of the homes on their shortlist they charge a fee but as they negotiate with the vendor s estate agent they can produce larger reductions on the selling price than the individual buyer could achieve add an immeasurable saving in hassle and family stress and buying agents can prove worthwhile if you want an expensive standard item such as a flat in knightsbridge central london but find it daunting to work through the estate agents lists then a buying agent will do the hard work study the lists and traipse around town to find a place to suit you and your way of life buying agents create a level playing field in the game of winning a new nest with their help it can become an emotion free commercial deal and when it is a matter of saying no you have a third party to do it for you for example flats and family houses are a routine request for london company property vision if you are famous or rich or both an extra advantage is that the vendor and his agent will not need to know your name until a deal is settled a buying agent starts by learning as much as possible about you and your family and where you aspire to live a visit to your existing home is essential unless you are overseas the agent sees how you live and what you want to improve on in a new home expatriates should provide as much information as possible then comes the search bedrock international starts in the office sitting you in front of a screen for a computerised armchair tour you call up pictures of possible properties and see if they appeal another plus is that buying agents can often find properties that have not been put up for public sale property vision calls it the invisible market keeping an ear to the ground the agents hear of houses that owners are reluctant to admit to having to sell why perhaps because of two of the property world s three ds debt and divorce the third is death rupert bradstock of property vision suggests that some owners worried about market conditions did not want to risk their houses failing to sell and thus going stale his company bought more than pounds 17m worth of country houses last year 53 per cent of them invisibly last year s coup for wilson wilson was to buy doddington park a stately home in gloucestershire

contacts local knowledge you know he said the searches lead to a shortlist on which the buying agent can give a full and frank report on the properties that is useful as information in brochures becomes thinner as tad zurlinden of the association of relocation agents points out the agent will also advise on schools golf clubs hunts shops and all other local matters and will know a surveyor to call on quickly the buyer then visits the properties with the agent possibly without the vendor being present all that remains is to make a choice and instruct the agent to make an offer and negotiate it is no surprise that buying agents occasionally end up as friends of their clients after holding their hands figuratively and discovering what they think really matters which takes time to learn they come to know them well fees are in two parts a preliminary retainer pays for the agent s out of pocket expenses and shows that you are serious and will commit yourself acting fast if need be if it has a limited term an extension may be negotiable wilson wilson s retainer is pounds 750 stacks pounds 400 and property vision s pounds 1 000 add vat to all sums once the deal has been agreed the retainer is usually set against the main fee which is a percentage of the buying price and often 1 5 or 2 per cent sometimes 2 5 per cent the property service in london charges 1 per cent with a minimum charge of pounds 2 000 for a truly expensive property you may be able to elicit a discount county homesearch has a variation it charges the greater of 1 per cent of the buying price or 15 per cent of the saving negotiated between the asking price and the buying price it is an incentive for us to find our clients the right property at the right price the company says property vision will negotiate with the vendor s agent for a property the client has found on his own for 1 5 per cent buying agents must be prepared to advise a client not to proceed if the property is in the wrong place or is too expensive some clients need the sergeant major s approach zurlinden says it means they do not waste their money if a house on the invisible market costs too much property vision advises clients to wait until the owner puts it on the open market in the 1980s when plenty of property was for sale relocation agents helped private buyers in the recession they found themselves working for companies that were moving and needed to rehouse their staff the sort of task that hambros countrywide relocation specialises in and were successful in pushing down prices last year private buyers

charge of departments two have retired early in recent months amid rumours of clashes with their political masters in november sir geoffrey holland announced his departure from the department for education after barely 10 months in the post at 55 and after a glittering career as head of first the manpower services commission and then the department of employment he was leaving whitehall to become vice chancellor of exeter university he jumped with a golden umbrella and a big smile on his face a spokesman for the department for education suggested others were less sanguine it was widely reported that he had fallen out with mr john patten the education secretary either he goes or i do he is rumoured to have told colleagues it is improbable that such a polished performer said anything of the sort but there was a problem over rapport with sir geoffrey said to be frustrated at the inability of mr patten to think big too much time was spent fire fighting dealing with problems over issues such as school testing that many in the department felt were self induced this week sir clive whitmore top man at the home office confirmed he was also off before retirement age his imminent move to an unspecified well paid job in the private sector was linked with reports of friction in the department between civil servants and mr michael howard the home secretary unlike sir geoffrey sir clive circulated a memo to his officials denying a rift with his secretary of state but there is no doubting the unhappiness among many senior home office mandarins over the home secretary s robust approach to law and order they see the rapidly increasing prison population as a policy designed to strengthen mr howard s claims in a future tory leadership battle that he has not been willing to listen to their objections or study evidence suggesting the policy will be an expensive failure adds insult to injury i can t understand why clive hasn t exploded in public instead of simply retiring

conversion to the roman catholic church after the church of england decided to ordain women mr gummer was already in his officials bad books after last year s public expenditure battle when he conceded cuts in his budget of more than pounds 1bn he is now condemned by senior mandarins for what they regard as an unforgivable sin his alleged reluctance to read briefs departmental business has ground to a halt they say as he wrestles with his conscience over matters spiritual elsewhere in whitehall there is a struggle for turf over the new job seeker s allowance for the unemployed to be introduced in 1996 merging unemployment benefit and income support for the jobless will cost thousands of civil service jobs the department of social security believes its benefits agency should pay the new allowance the employment department says job seekers are the province of the employment service which runs programmes to help the unemployed back into work a similar battle can be expected over proposals to merge the inland revenue and customs and excise revealed in yesterday s ft these two treasury departments are unlikely to surrender their independence without a fight and the interminable tug of war continues over responsibility for training the departments of trade and industry education and employment are all unwilling to give up their share of this market even the foreign office under the unflappable mr douglas hurd is not immune from fear and loathing an unprecedented meeting of london based staff was summoned in january to hear the foreign secretary try to soothe fears on the future of the diplomatic service there is an awful lot of turbulence around according to a civil servant in charge of an executive agency ministers haven t got their act together the thrashing around gets back to senior colleagues who are becoming very concerned it all creates great uncertainty that uncertainty is amplified by the scott inquiry into the arms for iraq scandal which has sent a frisson through whitehall the public interrogation of senior civil servants by lord justice scott and ms presiley baxendale his steely counsel has set what many see as a dangerous precedent it came as a great shock to learn that ministers private memos could be produced in court says one grade 3 civil servant in charge of a policy area in a large department it s much harder to get decisions out of ministers now they are no longer willing to commit their thoughts to paper and delay everything for meetings whoever is responsible for current indecision and delays mandarins have long griped about the shortcomings of their political masters in their pall mall clubs professor peter hennessy the whitehall historian quotes the example of mr george turner a permanent secretary at the wartime ministry of supply who was prone to describe the department s ministers as our two parliamentary liabilities downstairs neither of the ministers in question could be called political slouches mr harold macmillan went on to become prime minister while mr duncan sandys had a distinguished cabinet career and was colonial secretary that the standard moans have become louder is seen by many as a consequence of the reforms imposed on the civil service since mrs thatcher came to power in 1979 civil servants have had to digest manpower cuts privatisations the creation of more than 80 agencies to deliver services the citizen s charter and pay freezes the most hated reform has been market testing the programme under which civil servants must compete for their own jobs against bidders from the private sector the civil service has traditionally been regarded as an unrisky profession says ms kate jenkins a former high flying civil servant now a consultant on public service reform now it has been involuntarily exposed to risk in a way that civil servants would not have expected when they joined the service the standard civil service response under such an onslaught is the sort of backchat and griping that is now the dominant signal on the whitehall bush telegraph another is foot dragging which has been clearly visible in the slow progress over the first 18 months of market testing figures this week from the cabinet office show that several departments have yet to finish half the market testing programme that should have been completed by the end of last september they include social security trade and industry education and the lord chancellor s department embarrassingly the treasury guardian of the nation s purse is also among the laggards and the office of public service and science the cabinet office division in charge of whitehall reform has barely done better with just over half its programme finished the final straw for many mandarins has been the recent report from the cabinet office efficiency unit on top appointments in the civil service it talks about opening up the top jobs to outsiders advertising all posts and introducing contracts of service says one aggrieved civil servant it s all very unsettling these sentiments might easily be put down to fears that promotion would be blocked by such measures yet this civil servant is of an age when he has no further career ambitions his concern is over the effect on those further down the ladder who will see the best jobs awarded to people brought in from the private sector ministers tendency to denigrate the civil service exacerbates these fears says a former civil servant who is now a public sector consultant with a large accountancy firm ministers have this ethos that there s nothing very good about the civil service he says they neglect its strengths the collegiate approach in which no decision is taken without consulting a wide range of people and thinking through long term consequences politicians no longer see civil servants as professional advisers says another ex civil servant increasingly they treat them as gophers prof hennessy sees this mishandling of the civil service as a reflection of the decline of the british political class civil servants always like working for the big figures like willie lord whitelaw and dennis lord healey they re even quite fond of current grandees such as douglas hurd and michael heseltine it s the meagre placemen they don t like the small minded ideologues who have risen without trace civil servants have also been wrong footed by the unexpected radicalism of mr major on civil service reform according to mr graham mather president of the european policy forum the independent think tank they had expected things to calm down after mrs thatcher went and they haven t since mr major shows no signs of abating his radicalism in this policy area the hard times look set to continue expect more

recovery back home but he will also find it more difficult to make a case for cutting interest rates should he wish to do so evidence from the first of this month s batch of economic statistics would seem to bear out the bank s optimism figures published last week showed that manufacturing output increased by 1 1 per cent in january a much larger rise than was expected while december s drop was revised to just 0 2 per cent housing starts rose by an annual rate of 16 per cent in the three months to january although from a low base government estimates of net lending to consumers in january showed a sharp drop from december 1993 but figures from the finance and leasing association which are taken from a wider base disclosed a 37 per cent year on year rise in gross lending between january 1993 and january 1994 the sharp rise in bond yields witnessed in recent weeks suggests that investors in bonds share the optimism over growth yields on 10 year gilts now stand a little under a percentage point higher than at the beginning of the year the rise in the yield on index linked gilts implies that about half of this increase is due to higher real interest rates the remainder is due to a rise in inflationary expectations both presumably reflect greater confidence about the prospects for economic growth partly worldwide but partly also in the uk strong demand yesterday s trade figures confirm the picture of strong demand the surge in imports in december and upward revisions to the trade deficit for the whole of last year also rekindle fears that the uk economy will suck in imports and run into balance of payments problems as it starts growing reasonably rapidly the rise in manufacturing output gives some reason to be optimistic on this score however since manufactures constitute such a large proportion of the country s traded goods the output figures also show that production of investment goods rose by nearly 4 per cent in january while that of consumer goods fell slightly there may be evidence here of a shift towards investment led growth essential if a rapid recovery is to prove sustainable nevertheless what is happening to consumption will be of more immediate interest to mr clarke as he contemplates the effect the imminent tax rises may have on the economy consumer expenditure grew at an annual rate of 3 2 per cent in the final quarter of last year which confirms that personal consumption much the biggest component of demand is the driving force behind the recovery but the measures announced by mr clarke and his predecessor mr lamont in last year s two budgets represent a net fiscal adjustment of pounds 12 8bn the tax bill of a married man on average earnings will be pounds 12 50 a month heavier after april reduced savings taxpayers disposable incomes are going to be hit hard as the labour party has delighted in pointing out if the consumer led recovery is not going to grind to a halt consumers will have to reduce their rate of savings in fact they have already begun to do so the savings rate fell from a peak of 13 per cent in the middle of 1992 to 10 6 per cent in the third quarter of 1993 but if real consumer expenditure is to continue growing at 2 5 per cent a year at a time of stagnant real disposable incomes the savings rate will need to fall to 6 per cent by the end of 1995 the consensus is growing among commentators including the chancellor s own panel of independent forecasters that the recovery should survive the increased tax burden needless to say there are also dissenting voices who refuse to accept that the savings rate is set to decline so sharply unemployment needs to continue its decline if the precautionary element in savings is to fall house prices which rose 3 8 per cent in february will also have to recover still further if consumers are to feel confident about their wealth despite these doubts it would be a brave chancellor who ignored the outspoken comments of the governor of the bank of england it seems increasingly likely that policymakers will wait until the effects of next month s tax rises become evident before deciding whether to make further changes in interest

wei is under arrest or under surveillance but his movements have been severely curtailed while mr warren christopher the us secretary of state is in beijing this weekend thus in feudal tradition a naysayer has been banished from the capital to spare china s rulers a troublesome presence chinese history is replete with such examples wei s treatment is a reminder that even in the country s modernisation phase official behaviour sometimes owes more to the past than to the present the 44 year old wei was reported by his secretary to be in good spirits for someone who emerged last year from more than 14 years in jail including a stint in a penal colony in remote and harsh qinghai province his temporary exile in tianjin must seem like a mild inconvenience not that wei the former red guard and people s liberation army soldier is likely to be much fazed whatever his circumstances suggestions that he had suffered a mental breakdown while in jail proved unfounded my will was strengthened and so was my determination to increase people s awareness of democracy he told the financial times recently wei may not have the international stature of a sakharov the soviet nuclear scientist condemned to internal exile during the brezhnev years but in the chinese context he is a central figure as the unofficial leader of a tiny fragmented dissident community chinese official nervousness of wei s ability to use an occasion such as mr christopher s visit to amplify his call for political freedom both at home and abroad is perhaps not surprising fresh in chinese memory is the embarrassing row that marred president george bush s visit to beijing in 1989 months before the tiananmen square massacre after moves by the authorities to prevent the dissident professor fang lizhi from attending a presidential banquet that episode perhaps more than any other rendered prof fang a dissident hero in his own country and gave him exceptional prominence internationally he was exiled to the us in 1990 and has become a remote figure to his countrymen however lao wei old wei as he is known in the dissident community has remained close to his roots and since his release from jail last september has continued to press his views among his fellow dissidents and in conversations with journalists and diplomats western officials say that it would be a mistake to exaggerate wei s political importance in a country where the few dissenting voices are barely heard above a whisper but equally he could become a rallying point in a time of crisis wei s dissident colleagues make no attempt to hide their admiration for his commitment and sacrifice liu xiaobo one of the leaders or so called black hands behind the pro democracy protests of 1989 says he is one of the few democracy fighters to devote himself totally to the cause if you don t have such a spirit of devotion you can t survive very long in such a totalitarian system wei cannot be faulted for lack of staying power he first came to notice in 1978 during the brief beijing political spring as perhaps the most literate of the pro democracy activists who made their voices heard in big character posters pasted on the grimy wall of a beijing bus station on the city s main boulevard his most enduring testament and one that angered deng xiaoping was a poster entitled the fifth modernisation which appeared on democracy wall on december 5 1978 this was a cheeky play on the four modernisations campaign embraced by the communist party a month or so previously which had pointedly excluded any reference to political liberalisation what is true democracy wei had asked rhetorically it means the right of people to choose their own representatives who will work according to their will and in their interests only this can be called democracy these views were a deep affront to communist rulers emerging from the years of chaos of the cultural revolution their misgivings were compounded when wei dared to suggest in contributions to the underground magazine exploration that the communist party itself had failed and worse that deng himself had a flawed appreciation of china s needs this was too much for mr deng who has never shown much squeamishness about dealing with dissent in the spring of 1979 wei was sentenced to 15 years in jail for leaking military secrets to a foreign journalist and for counter revolutionary activities the penalties seemed excessive even by the standards of the time and wei s incarceration proved a blight on china s reputation throughout the 1980s his release last september six months before his jail term expired on the eve of the vote awarding the 2000 olympics to sydney was a crude attempt to boost china s chances of hosting the games whatever wei s feelings about being used as a pawn in the olympics chess game he showed quickly that he had lost none of his appetite for controversy he dared the communist party to meet the challenge of change china is changing so how can the communist party remain unchanged he asked reporters the question is whether that change can keep up with the pace of change in society if it can t then i m afraid what has happened in the soviet union and eastern europe will happen here people will rise up and topple the government and then there will be turmoil i hope party members will be wise enough to keep pace with the wishes of the people and thus achieve a smooth transition with mr deng slipping away and with wei in reasonably good health in spite of his long ordeal it is just possible that china s leading

for a start and a grim coming to terms with the detritus of one s past when sorting out old belongings and the costs can make a sizeable charge at the bottom of the overall bill the more you

in the north oxfordshire town of banbury houses for sale on their patch range from old village cottages and 19th century workmen s terrace houses through recent lower and middle income estates to old rectories manor houses and a few stately homes in assessing fees bear in mind that they may be different at other branches or in london lane fox and savills sit side by side in banbury but their prices differ i asked them the cost of selling two houses one in the pounds 450 000 pounds 550 000 range and the other a pounds 60 000 property which is roughly the average house price in the department of the environment and halifax indices lane fox suggested around 2 per cent of the selling price plus the necessary vat as a fee for the large house to market it effectively this house would need a colour brochure and national advertising which we trust would mean the weekend ft as well as country life where a half page colour advertisement would cost pounds 1 500 the vendor pays these expenses totalling around pounds 2 000 pounds 3 500 plus vat the fee for the pounds 60 000 house would be 2 per cent to include a simpler brochure and local advertising savills suggested much the same 2 2 5 per cent as an inclusive fee for the cheaper house and 2 per cent plus the expenses which might amount to pounds 2 000 pounds 4 000 plus vat for the larger house nationwide would ask for 2 per cent plus vat for sole agency as a set fee to include local advertising and photography no sale no fee account holders with nationwide might obtain a 10 per cent reduction so ask when selling ask at least two agents who know your type of home to quote do not necessarily choose the firm with the cheapest fee or which suggests the highest asking price it may have over valued in order to gain your instructions in which case buyers will not come to view a reasonably priced house can sell at close to the asking price or above when there is competition look hard at the firms which sell your type of home if you think fees are high they are much higher on the continent and in the us surveys still in banbury i asked chartered surveyor paul lester of lesters what he would charge for the two houses he offers three types of survey a home buyer s report suits a modern property and most buyers it uses a royal institution of chartered surveyors printed form which has a paragraph on every aspect of the building as the basis of a thorough inspection the charge would be pounds 175 pounds 250 plus vat an intermediate survey for pounds 300 pounds 350 would look harder at the principal defects such as settlement dry rot and damp a full structural survey could cost anything from pounds 350 to pounds 1 000 depending on the size of the property and the difficulty of access to roof spaces and other hidden parts most surveys of this type are in the pounds 400 pounds 450 range lester is surprised how many people do not take surveys if they do they are not grateful when you have found something wrong they do not want any threat to stop their new dream coming true but on a full survey it is rare that the buyer cannot save pounds 1 000 provided his offer is subject to

corridor between reading and bristol suggested a likely bill of pounds 250 pounds 325 plus vat to include minor expenses such as copying and stamps the main fee depends on how much work is involved which is unpredictable this figure is about the same as in 1980 because of the competition among solicitors to service the smaller number of property transactions in the recession years it does not include disbursements for local authority and other searches which have risen and vary from one authority to another but the authorities are now quicker at producing the information it is the mortgage offer that holds things up that is usually the last piece of the jigsaw said arber there is also the land registration fee which rises in bands and stamp duty starting above pounds 60 000 at 1 per cent of the total price not of the excess over pounds 60 000 for the pounds 500 000 house stamp duty would be pounds 5 000 and the land registration fee pounds 1 800 a likely solicitor s bill would be pounds 750 pounds 1500 plus vat arber said because it is usually more work and there is an element of insurance in the bill if something goes wrong the solicitor is liable for much more i then asked one of the solicitors in bedford row london what he would charge he pointed out that the cheap house could make as much work as the expensive one and suggested as a rough guide half the agent s fee thus around 1 per cent plus vat both solicitors stressed how important it was to find a good lawyer who checked everything unqualified people are doing more of the work now said amber and they make mistakes that can lead to trouble in years ahead if you get a low estimate for the solicitor s bill ask who in the office will actually be doing the work the local solicitors advantage is that they

lenders offer they want business and it is wise to shop around nationwide for instance has no application fee at present and the basic valuation is free for fixed rates mortgages there is a

pounds 250 cashback about a month after completion which virtually pays the maximum pounds 300 fee cheltenham and gloucester has removed application and valuation fees for home buyers taking out a new

do you have how much will you pack yourself for journeys of less than 100 miles labour is a large part of the cost banbury removals suggested a possible range of pounds 250 pounds 350 plus vat for

clear from the early stages of the investigation that the government s policy on exports to iraq was not black and white there was quite an evident will in some whitehall circles after the iran iraq ceasefire to modify the policy he added the investigation and prosecution conceded that there was plenty of government suspicion perhaps bordering upon knowledge that some if not many machine tools were going to iraq for military use since this was conceded by customs it was not felt to be an area worth prolonged investigation had the alleged breached of export regulations occurred in relation

encouraging they are not as positive as they might be current growth rates among the best african performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades so far the

most african governments had adopted world bank supported structural adjustment programmes the six leading reformers reduced budget deficits curbed inflation introduced competitive exchange rates tariff reforms and agricultural incentives countries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture have seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops says the bank the study also shows that it is not always true that devaluation necessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were complementing policies of wage fiscal and monetary restraint and indeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market export volumes increased significantly despite declining terms of trade if the exchange rate agricultural

explains go to knight frank in london and they will tell you exactly how much you have to pay to buy a flat in knightsbridge the market there is efficient in that if you are prepared to pay more than the odds you will definitely get what you want from the seller s point of view the converse holds true drop your price from the market level and you ll find a buyer but that says kienzle is not the case in germany where information on what is for sale and for how much is hard to come by there are no for sale signs and national chains of estate agents are few as you might expect in germany s strongly regionalised economy the market is local in character knowledge gleaned in munich will not be of much help if you are posted to frankfurt or dusseldorf even within the regions the market is fragmented in the frankfurt area for example few agents will be able to give you an overview of prices for the whole city and its satellite towns the market in the frankfurt region is controlled by at least 1 000 maklers brokers most of whom specialise in a small area the expert on the market for flats in the expensive west end of the city centre is unlikely to know much about villas for sale in nearby dormitory towns such as bad homburg bad vilbel or kronberg assuming fluency in german and a degree of familiarity with local tax law you should reckon on at least a year between arriving in germany and buying a house says one banker who has just bought a property on the outskirts of frankfurt the most important thing you must bring with you when you re considering buying a house is time agrees kienzle the inefficiency of the market means there are bargains to be had occasionally but you have to be there long enough to spot them when they become available it follows that international executives who might be posted to frankfurt would be well advised to rent a flat or a house on arrival and buy only if they are likely to be staying for five years or more the chance of making a substantial capital gain in less than five years is small says dr walter fuhrberg managing director of blumenauer immobilien one of the larger property agencies in frankurt house prices in the frankfurt area have risen at 4 to 5 per cent a year since the late 1980s not enough to justify a speculative purchase especially in view of the costs and complications of buying this a far cry from the giddy price movements in the uk residential property market but the stable price development reflects germans deep rooted fear of inflation as well as a reluctance to treat home buying as a form of financial speculation germans do not regard houses and flats as a commodity as something to be bought and sold says a broker in the stuttgart area buying a house is very serious and very formal for most people it is an enormous step signifying that you ve made it and you are settling down for life indeed in germany as a whole only around 40 per cent of the population owns a house compared with a europe wide average of 60 per cent if you are very rich there are tax advantages associated with owning residential property and renting it out there are also tax benefits if you build your own property very popular in a country where unlike britain there is little sentiment attached to living in an old house another incentive to buy comes from the low cost of money interest rates for home loans have fallen far more steeply that short term rates in the past 18 months in the frankfurt area prices range from dm500 000 pounds 200 000 for a small flat in a good area to dm5m or more for a villa in the taunus hills outside the town rents range from dm15 dm25 per square metre often with a service charge and bills on top it could be that the cost of financing a mortgage is now below the rental costs of living in a similar property against this you must weigh the fee of 5 per cent of the value of the house plus value added tax which you pay on purchase and maintenance costs there are also the non financial considerations such as the sheer complexity of finding and buying the house in which you would like to live renting remains the most straightforward option for all but the most long term expatriates at the top end of the market there is no shortage of properties and rents have fallen over the past couple of years renting is not without its complexities and frustrations however there is nothing more irritating than paying a fee to the makler who often seems to have done nothing other than put an advertisement in the paper and wait to be overwhelmed by calls from

june 1992 czechoslovak general elections but he was then quickly out manoeuvred by the czech leader mr vaclav klaus the czech refusal to finance his demands for autonomy just short of independence forced the slovak leader to take this country of 5m people into an independence which opinion polls showed only a small minority of slovak nationalists wanted since then mr meciar s highly personalised and aggressive political style has lost support for him and his party against the background of a widening gulf between living standards in the czech republic which has forged ahead with market reforms and slovakia the new republic came into existence in january 1993 with a weaker economy heavily weighted towards former comecon markets and based largely on inefficient heavy industry since independence market reforms have virtually stopped and the economy has declined further against a background of high inflation rising unemployment and a depreciating currency until now mr meciar

the war through a third winter he says although he does not spell out whether the un humanitarian aid effort helped fuel the military machine of all three sides in bosnia lord owen as he suggested earlier this year believes that aid frequently hijacked by the three armies has indirectly prolonged the fighting as the war erupted first in croatia and later in bosnia lord owen says that little thought was given to involving from the outset either the un or the russian federation he believes the russian s readiness to extend the consensus working arrangements in the security council developed in the gulf war to yugoslavia had been taken too much for granted and nearly came unstuck in february 1994 when nato issued the bosnian serbs with an ultimatum to withdraw its heavy weapons from around sarajevo or else risk air strikes he has little sympathy for washington s role in the present conflict or the european union s belief that it was all too ready to prove itself as an independent force in the field of foreign affairs indeed lord owen believes there are lessons the eu can learn the conflict could not have been solved by the eu alone once it was clear the us would not become involved and therefore nato as well we were too slow to involve the un and second had the threat of force nato air strikes for instance been used early particularly in vukovar in late 1991 perhaps the war would not have spread to bosnia but that would have required support from the us the only hope for an early peace is russia the eu and the us working together he concludes\n"}, {"id":

country alone by presidential decree should parliamentary elections later this month fail to produce a legally acceptable result such a move which could place mr kravchuk into a similar confrontation with his parliament as president boris yeltsin faced in russia last year is now being openly discussed by his close political advisers one senior adviser to the ukrainian president said we are very sure the parliamentary election scheduled for march 27 will not produce a result it will be a good opportunity for kravchuk to press ahead with reforms and stay in power until the end of his term until 1996 the adviser said that mr kravchuk had discussed the possibility of ruling ukraine by decree when he met president bill clinton in washington on march 4 while neither mr kravchuk nor the parliament has a record in radical economic reform the president blames parliament for blocking the few reform measures he has tried to push through last year the parliament foiled an attempt by mr kravchuk to loosen government control of land the opening mr kravchuk would need to run the ukraine unhindered by parliament arises out of a convoluted election law passed last november by the existing parliament elected while ukraine was still part of the soviet union some 6 000 candidates have registered for the march 27 poll an average of 13 per voting district under the law to win in the first round of voting a candidate must secure more than half the votes cast and more than half the electorate must cast their votes to win in a second round of voting planned for april the top two candidates in any district will square off under the same rules mr kravchuck s advisers believe that this is where the new voting law is flawed and that it will be difficult to draw more than half the electorate out to vote once and nearly impossible for a second time if the president and his men are right in predicting a low voter turn out parliament s electoral commission will be required by law to declare the elections invalid and thus potentially pave the way for presidential rule according to a presidential adviser mr kravchuk would finally have his opportunity to reform ukraine s disastrous economy by decree without a parliament to get in his way he would also cancel june presidential elections and convene a constituent assembly to redesign a political model presidential or parliamentary for the country last month mr kravchuk announced that he would not stand for early presidential elections this june but this now appears to have been a tactic to prepare the ground for cancelling presidential elections disbanding parliament and taking control of the country mr kravchuck remains the only ukrainian politician put in power by popular vote since the republic became independent the west is particularly concerned that mr kravchuk should remain in power until an agreement to scrap its nuclear missile arsenal signed in january in moscow is completed ukraine s

descent has been dizzying but at last it is beginning to slow having dropped further than most other european property markets during the 1990s it is clear that the worst is finally over for sweden recovery though remains elusive particularly for the commercial property sector vacancy rates are still extremely high and rents with few exceptions are declining the continuing oversupply means that the commercial property sector will only gradually stabilise but in contrast to a year ago at least there are some encouraging signs yields are falling for the first time since 1989 if only because of lower interest rates companies are not going bankrupt at anything like the rate that they were slowing the flow of additional properties onto the market and companies and public sector organisations are moving back into central stockholm again after a big exodus to peripheral regions of the city helping to push rent levels up slightly some stabilisation is not surprising given that capital values and rental prices have more than halved in stockholm since their 1990 peak in the centre of the city rents of skr1 500 2 000 a sq m are typical compared with skr3 500 4 000 four years ago a number of external factors are helping to arrest the decline they include a sharp drop in swedish interest rates since late 1992 gathering evidence of a general economic recovery and clear signs that the worst of the swedish banking crisis is over the return of stability to the financial sector has helped to calm the property market because collapsing real estate values were at the heart of the swedish banking crisis forcing banks to seize hundreds of properties both at home and abroad after loans to real estate companies went sour the melt down resulted in swedish financial institutions becoming some of the country s biggest property owners threatening to destabilise further an already unstable situation in fact the nightmare scenario of banks dumping properties wholesale onto the market was avoided thanks to the improvement in their own fortunes again a product of lower interest rates and the nature of government intervention generous state support meant bad bank entities such as securum and retriva were well capitalised ensuring they did not have to dispose of properties into a declining market contrary to what certain people feared the equivalent of two or three years turnover of property stock was prevented from flooding the market says mr erik persson research and development director with catella a property consulting group those who believe the market is about to turn base their optimism on a number of factors first the residential market is in a clear recovery phase thanks to much lower mortgage rates and a gradual loosening of the rent control system secondly commercial property yields have begun to fall having peaked at between 7 and 8 per cent in 1992 3 they are now below 7 per cent thirdly property company share prices have begun to outperform the stock market indeed the strong stock market run suggests it may only be a matter of time before investors switch some funds out of equities into other areas including property finally foreigners are showing a growing interest in the market enticed by low prices and the weak krona a german pension fund has paid skr285m for a large property in northern stockholm while an affiliate of credit lyonnais altus nord has been active in both stockholm and gothenburg i expect international buyers will make some large investments before the summer says mr jan wejdmark managing director of ljungquist fastighetsvarderingar yet reasons for believing that any recovery will be slow are plentiful office vacancies are still rising in most locations and rents are declining this is because unemployment continues to climb and companies are using space more efficiently in some areas of stockholm vacancy rates are as high as 15 to 20 per cent you can see from looking at other international cities that if vacancies are more than 10 per cent then rents will normally go down says mr wejdmark it is also difficult to see who the new breed of property investors will be some of the big players of the late 1980s such as insurance groups got their fingers so badly burned that they are likely to be far more cautious about investing in property in the future not surprisingly development activity has shrunk to a fraction of earlier levels in stockholm as little as 30 000 40 000 sq m will be completed during 1994 compared with as much as 400 000 sq m a year at the market peak yet with interest rates set to fall further this year the prospects for recovery look better today than at any time in the past five years but the revival will be slow if only because of the number of properties waiting to find a new home swedish financial institutions are estimated to have taken over properties worth between skr60bn and skr80bn during the bank crisis even this may not slow the recovery too much because it is only equivalent to one two years of normal turnover if you press down an air filled ball into the water for long enough it will eventually bounce back up again says mr persson\n"}, {"id":

in madrid as the kio towers after the kuwait investment office whose company prima inmobiliaria began to build them when the property market was booming in the late 1980s the company together with the

is now up and running and virtually filled up recently an insurance company genesis which is jointly owned by metropolitan life of the us and by banco santander the leading domestic bank acquired an 8 000 sq m block in the park one of the last available locations the acquisition by genesis appeared to indicate a trend if a bank like santander which knows the market very well is buying freehold it

energy company cepsa have rented large areas of office space in the campo richard ellis which together with healey and baker is a leading player in the domestic property market believes that suburbs and particularly business parks stand to gain as companies seek to relocate because of potentially rising leasehold costs in older city centre buildings the costs could rise sharply for companies with pre 1985 leases which will be deregulated when a new urban leasehold act comes into force later this year the act would have been on the statute book last year but was postponed when parliament was dissolved and new elections held the increased expense will be a distinct change for rental prices have come down strongly by as much as 40 per cent in some buildings early in 1993 the supply of offices along the prime prime castellana boulevard axis outstripped demand something which richard ellis points out nobody could have imagined but then again few expected that the spanish economy would fall so fast and so deeply into a recession midway through 1992 the painful shrinkage of the gdp came to a halt in the third quarter of last year and a moderate but sustained expansion is in place and will become evident in the second half of the current year on the property market the cycle appeared to be distinctly changing before the end of last year healey and baker estimates that vacancy rates along the castellana central business area will drop in the course of this year to a mere 6 per cent and there is a general consensus in the market that office rents are set to rise the ownership troubles that afflicted the gateway or the kio towers could consequently have been a blessing in disguise work has restarted on the two blocks after an interval of nearly 18 months and they are likely to be completed and ready for occupation in the spring of next year just when office space demand is expected to be growing strongly in barcelona where there is less demand for large office locations the great majority of corporate headquarters in spain are in madrid demand will pick up more moderately starting rental prices are similar in both cities but the vacancy rates in barcelona are appreciably higher than those in madrid international investors are mostly quiet in the office sector but there is increasing activity in retail properties and particularly in shopping centres the latter have mushroomed all over spain with good results but there is room for more growth the retail excitement will prod the office sector into activity sooner rather than later a key factor in this is that interest rates have come down fast in spain over the past eight months and are set to fall further in the months ahead developers can now acquire three year medium term finance at around 8 5

first time in post soviet history a presidential decree dating from october which has yet to be submitted to a parliament which may reject it allows for the unhindered sale and purchase of land except by foreigners who can only do so in partnership with russian companies under the old constitution the re sale of land was subject to a 10 15 year moratorium as privatisation has gathered pace there have also been more opportunities to buy property from owners who have acquired clear title to it but because it is largely due to a shortage of quality space the increase in unsatisfied demand has been in spite of rather than because of the progress with legislation there is more order in the system than less that still does not mean it is an ordered system but it means we are vaguely heading in the right direction says mr adrian moore in charge of property deals at the moscow office of solicitors norton rose mr moore says that some of the new property business comes from foreign companies such as his own which began leasing small amounts of space as an experiment and then decided to take larger premises as their business expanded in moscow a lot of the development is generated by new russian companies and banks which are more at ease with the system than foreigners a popular source of enrichment for underpaid officials has been the bribes paid by businessmen wishing to acquire property at exceptionally low prices and make a killing from its subsequent development in theory foreign companies and individuals can own buildings outright they can also lease land but not own it except when it is attached to a privatised enterprise but while picking one s way through the labyrinthine russian bureaucracy in order to obtain good title is possible and creates good business for lawyers western real estate developers say life remains tough apart from the red tape and the background fears that political instability could one day lead to expropriation it remains extremely difficult for developers to raise finance on the strength of russian property projects mr moore says the main obstacle is the absence of a system for registering a lender s legal charge or his right to realise his security the key thing any lender is looking for is to register the fact they made the loan and can take valid security over something like the development mr haluk gercek in charge of the moscow office of enka the turkish construction company which has been able to bring its own funds and bank finance to russian projects believes the main problem is psychological after 70 years of communism mr gercek finds that many russians have only a faint grasp of such concepts as private property venture capital and investment you can t fix this with laws and regulations it is a matter of long term acceptance of property rights and private ownership people think they are doing you a favour if they offer you investment opportunities without offering security for your capital as an example of russian attitudes to what constitutes an opportunity he cites russian officials who have offered enka buildings inhabited either by tenants with rights to the property or illegal squatters still he believes a presence on the russian market is essential to benefit from its future promise he claims that enka is now the biggest foreign contractor on the russian market and he says the company s reputation for getting jobs done faster and more cheaply than the competition helped clinch it a dollars 22m contract to help rebuild the white house after it was shelled by army tanks to quell last october s parliamentary rebellion mosenka enka s joint venture with the moscow city construction authorities has been renovating buildings on which it has a 25 to 49 year lease and renting them to foreigners the scarcity of properties mean that office space in moscow is among the most expensive in the world costing dollars 800 dollars 900 a sq m a year independently of its russian joint venture enka is presently studying projects whereby the moscow city government would give it dilapidated buildings which abound in the city to renovate in return for 50 per cent ownership of the final product with no guarantee that this will include the land beneath the buildings we are proceeding very slowly with foreign and russian lawyers so we can get as much security as possible that this won

are unlikely to get past the drawing board lots of schemes are talked about but few have a future he says the reason is not lack of demand for modern office space from the steady trickle of foreign companies attracted by poland s growing economy rather it is the difficulty of getting all the relevant parts of a project into place including the financing when dealing with local authorities which are jealous of influence from abroad according to mr roskelly warsaw needs between 60 000 sq m and 70 000 sq m of new office space a year much of it priced at rents of dollars 20 to dollars 25 a sq m banks and financial services companies want prestigious accommodation and they could fill a couple of buildings he says but larger companies are now also coming in on tight budgets and they want to pay the lower rents as do a growing number of local companies who are looking for the prestige of western style accommodation ms karolina kaim from jones lang wootton agrees that there is demand but not at the top end of the market where companies are now paying up to dollars 60 a sq m although about 60 000 sq m of office space came onto the market in 1993 rents have yet to start moving downwards meanwhile both jones lang wootton and dauntons gerald eve cite problems with getting planning and building permissions from local authorities as a pertinent barrier to development the local authorities tend not to like foreign developers so polish architects and engineers are taken in to provide projects with a local veneer but they have yet to learn to appreciate fully the commercial aspects of a project or the needs of a western institutional client all this increases the soft costs which have to be incurred before planning permission can be obtained and financing arranged there are also still problems with land title and the issue is especially acute in warsaw where owners of the ruined city were dispossessed en bloc after the war successive governments have promised to resolve the problem of restitution but a law dealing with the subject has yet to be passed by parliament nevertheless two projects are under construction there is the 15 000 sq m fim tower being built near the five year old lim centre which houses 20 000 sq m of office space and the marriott hotel and which will soon become the first office block to have paid for itself and there is also the aktyn

centre the other is the atrium 80 000 sq m of office and retail space which is a joint venture between the swedish skanska company and the wola district in the polish capital as for hotels a spate of building activity in the past three years has provided a temporary surfeit of rooms at the top end of the market indeed warsaw has enough four and five star hotels and now needs some well located three star accommodation according to the experts the forte s bristol hotel with its 207 rooms refurbished at a cost of about dollars 40m is struggling to service its debt as occupancy last year oscillated around the 50 per cent mark other recently constructed hotels include the french run mercure and the colourful sobieski whose lack of air conditioning makes it difficult to attract clients

retail and residential centre is rising out of the ashes of the fire that destroyed the heart of lisbon s historic chiado shopping district in 1988 but it will only go a short way towards meeting the massive demand for retail space that is currently dominating the portuguese property market big international retailers such as hard rock cafe virgin records and british home stores are poised to move

outstrips supply new rents for shops in the central avenida da liberdade or chiado areas have reached es15 000 a sq m a month more than three times the prices paid in the relatively depressed office market where supply exceeds demand the new chiado development conceived by mr alvaro siza vieira portugal s most respected architect in a style reminiscent of the original 18th century buildings is due to be largely completed by the end of 1995 and will absorb only a small part of this demand many of the original retailers will be entitled to reoccupy the area with the result that only a few new sites will come onto the market it will be comprised of 30 per cent office space 30 per cent retail and 40 per cent residential the aim in building residential apartments is to bring new life to the city centre almost no one lives there at present and the area becomes a deserted shell as soon as shops and offices close a factor that partly explains why the fire was already out of control before the alarm was raised lisbon still lacks quality new shops says mr george craven director of lisbon based sofica savills buildings in the chiado reconstruction are now being completed but they stand against part finished structures and work yet to be begun leaving retailers who are being asked prime rents nervous about returning to the area however three other important developments will relieve the pressure for retail sites over the next few years the colombus centre a mixed development in the benfica suburb of lisbon will place 133 000 sq m of shopping space on the market by 1997 says mr eric van leuven managing director in portugal of healey baker laying claim to being one of the biggest shopping centres in europe el corte ingles the spanish department store will take up a 30 000 sq m anchor store in a development to be built around a new hilton hotel alongside lisbon s eduardo vii park by 1997 an additional 20 000 sq m will be made available for smaller shops in the town of oeiras a few miles from lisbon a 40 000 sq m shopping centre with its own important catchment area should be ready by early 1996 in contrast to the buoyant retail sector the market for central lisbon office space is suffering from the effects of substantial oversupply rents have fallen about 35 per cent over the past two years to a current level of es4 500 sq m demand is strong with an annual take up of some 60 000 sq m that has remained steady over the past five years but the vacancy rate is about 6 per cent with 100 000 sq m of new office space and 50 000 sq m of secondhand offices unoccupied in lisbon this rate compares favourably with cities such as madrid paris or london but is a symptom of growing difficulties in lisbon where there have been no vacancies at all in recent years another 75 000 sq m of new office space is expected to come onto the lisbon market in 1994 and the level of new building is unlikely to diminish over the next few years this will push up vacancy rates increase oversupply and hold down rents because new rents are falling closer to the level of older rents many companies are moving out of dilapidated inefficient buildings in the centre of lisbon into more modern developments the clear choice of multinationals is for out of town or edge of town business parks where new rents are currently about es4 100 and conditions including traffic and parking are more attractive some companies that took up offices in the late 1980s when rents were at their peak are also keen to move says mr van leuven under portuguese law rents rise with inflation these companies may now be paying es8 000 sq m when they could rent new premises for almost half that a crucial factor in stimulating portugal s underdeveloped investment market will be the approval of a new commercial lease law the current law provides tenants with perpetual security of tenure without any open market rent reviews the new law will provide for fixed term contracts after which rents can

efficient telecommunications a good transport infrastructure a clean and attractive environment and a high quality of life says mr vincent as budapest prague and warsaw develop there may be less incentive to go to vienna as more companies may chose to base themselves directly in those cities but many western companies have already been disillusioned by the slow pace of improvement of their transport infrastructure and telecommunications as well as the generally poor environment a richard ellis report argues vienna it says is likely to remain a regional centre for austria hungary and the czech and slovak republics for the medium term which should be good news for investors and developers who found vienna a difficult market to enter owner occupation in vienna stands at around 80 per cent with the market dominated by banks and insurance companies which in turn own property development and construction companies says a report by john lang wootton people here tend to hold on to their property and that makes for a very illiquid market says mr vincent the residential market also continues to suffer from rent and tenancy controls that give almost unlimited security of tenure to occupiers agents say recently approved legislation has made matters worse by further strengthening protection for tenants landlords have no incentive to maintain their property in vienna and this could lead to some serious degradation as a result of neglect in a few years time says one agent meanwhile several projects have recently been completed or will be completed shortly with a few large developments in the pipeline supply has exceeded demand since 1991 leading to a vacancy rate of about 5 per cent today although agents say this is not high by international comparison with demand for office space averaging about 130 000 sq m a year supply peaked at 290 00 sq m in 1993 and is expected to fall to 150 000 sq m this year and 80 000 sq m in 1995 in and near the city centre there are several important developments ranging in size from a 7 000 sq m office building recently completed by groupe pierre 1er of france to a planned 80 000 sq m of offices apartments and shops at wien mitte in a project originally led by sweden s spp let but taken over by bank austria and domestic partners after spp let sold out further out from the centre developments range from the huge donau city project with a planned 470 000 sq m of offices apartments shops and a big hotel in the north east of the city to the 37 000 sq m concorde business park vienna s only purpose built business park on the road to the airport four office developments two of which have already been completed and let totalling 160 000 sq m are planned along lasallestrasse on the main north east axis out of vienna and business park vienna a 60 000 sq m development with offices and a hotel in the south of the city the donau city project dwarfs all others by its size and its ambition to become vienna s second city centre the first phase of construction representing about 40 per cent of the total development including all basic infrastructure and some 70 000 sq m of residential office and commercial space is expected to be completed in 1997 the rest of the development will be completed at a more leisurely pace depending on market demand an official said outside vienna the market is small with some

european property 11 economic downturn catches up brussels is suffering from the same problems that have afflicted other european markets belgium", "body": "until recently the resilience of the brussels property market has made it the envy of many of its recession hit neighbours the european union which together with the belgian government occupies some 60 per cent of brussels offices appeared to insulate the brussels market from the effects of the european economic downturn no longer brussels is now suffering from the same problems of reduced demand and rising vacancy rates that have afflicted other european markets the cost of renting space declined last year marking the end of a period of continuous rental growth since 1980 the extent of this downturn took some observers by surprise we had hoped that brussels would not be hit too much because of the eu s presence says mr philippe winssinger of dtz winssinger property advisers in fact the recession has been worse than we anticipated as a result of a lot of domestic companies cutting back on their need for space and multinationals reducing the size of their brussels operation office vacancy rates stand at about 8 per cent compared with a low of about 3 per cent in 1989 on the face of it demand for office space remained at a high level with about 300 000 sq m being let or sold to occupiers however a large proportion of that was accounted for by a single deal namely belgacom s acquisition of the 110 000 sq m tour pleiad in addition the eu accounted for about 15 per cent of the total take up many of the remaining occupiers have shed staff and reduced their requirements for space it is now far more common for demand for space to originate from groups looking to move to smaller offices than those contemplating an increase in their occupation says richard ellis chartered surveyors there are marked variations in the state of the letting market according to the location quality and age of building the brunt of the increase in vacancy rates has affected the city centre and leopold district the main eu and financial area where rents have fallen by 15 20 per cent by contrast the office market in the periphery of brussels has been more stable it has benefited from companies leaving the centre of brussels to escape traffic congestion and increased local taxes a new office tax introduced in brussels in 1989 increased the tax burden on office occupiers by about 20 per cent which is enough to offset the benefits of lower rents a widening gap is also opening up between new and old offices where the rental differential is some 10 15 per cent the decline in rents is likely to stop in the near future in new buildings because they will be taken up in preference to older buildings in the view of mr michel pilette of jones lang wootton he estimates that three quarters of the new space which currently accounts for a third of the available stock will be let by the end of the year in older buildings however rents are likely to continue to decline particularly as investors are proving reluctant to spend money on refurbishment some factors however encourage confidence that the letting market will revive although eu budgets are currently constrained its requirement for offices is likely to grow as it embraces new members moreover there is little new property coming onto the market the current speculative development programme will add just 137 000 sq m of space less than 2 per cent to the total office stock according to richard ellis the city s tight planning controls will ensure that the future supply of new stock is constrained despite the current travails of the letting market there has been a marked improvement in the investment market this was stimulated by the decline in interest rates which pushed the cost of money below property yields in many cases total investment was close to a record of bfr28 30bn last year compared with bfr15 18bn in the previous year private belgian investors have been important players in the market through securitisation which offers tax advantages two such belgian real estate certificates were sold last year one for 37 000 sq m in the green belt for bfr5 3bn on a yield of 7 5 per cent and one in the avenue marcel thiry for 10 000 sq m of offices for bfr1 06bn on a yield of 7 6 per cent at present investors remain cautious as they confine their interest to high quality buildings which are less than 15 years old with good leases but the return of investors to the market is likely to gather momentum believes mr winssinger we are at a stage where the uk was a year ago with high yields low rents and low cost of money a year ago there was a lot of product but limited buyers now that has reversed he says\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4232", "title": "ft 11 mar 94 survey of european property 9 more resilient than most there was a marked pick up in demand for good quality buildings in the second half of 1993 after two sluggish years the netherlands", "body": "the recession has dealt lightly with the dutch property market while it has not escaped entirely from rising vacancy rates stagnating rents and sluggish investment markets it has remained more stable than most of its continental european counterparts this resilience can in part be attributed to the decentralised structure of the dutch property market dutch businesses are scattered throughout the principle netherlands cities of amsterdam rotterdam the hague and utrecht as a result rents are rarely driven up by the pressure of demand and therefore dutch property rental values tend to be lower and more stable that other european cities another factor influencing the stability of the market is the dominant role played by institutions this means that property is usually funded with equity rather than bank finance as a result there is little pressure on property owners to sell property during the trough of a cycle in a downturn there is the appearance of a stable market says mr glen cowan of jones lang wootton property advisers there is no distressed selling many property owners are hoping that the downturn is over as far as the investment market is concerned there was a marked pick up in demand for good quality buildings in the second half of 1993 after two sluggish years the upturn was particularly pronounced in the retail sector which accounted for almost 60 per cent of the fl2 2bn invested in property last year as interest rates fell the high initial yields available on property have begun to look more attractive the improvement in the investment market has not embraced poorer quality buildings for which yields have increased by about one percentage point however fully let well located buildings in amsterdam rotterdam the hague and utrecht are in demand yields have dropped by between a quarter and a half of a percentage point in the largest single office investment deal ever done in amsterdam mbo development arm of internationale nederlanden group sold its 34 000 sq m atrium building in amsterdam south to zurich life insurance on a yield of under 6 5 per cent the fortunes of the occupational market are generally less encouraging although they vary markedly from sector to sector the retail market has been relatively robust in 1993 with vacancy rates of just 1 2 per cent some prime units which were let between 1989 and 1992 may now be slightly over rented as a result of a slight decline in consumer spending according to richard ellis but shopping centres with strong anchor tenants and individual secondary retail units are continuing to experience some rental growth the strength of the retail property market has prompted developers to draw up plans for a significant number of new shopping centres these proposals add about 300 000 sq m of retail space to the pipeline bringing the projected development total to about 1m sq m in the industrial sector the economic downturn resulted in a 15 per cent drop in institutional demand according to dtz despite this small modern industrial units are in short supply most of the surplus space is in relatively large industrial complexes overall rents remained stable last year in the office market there is on the face of it little cause for concern last year demand for offices rose sharply to a record 1 37m sq m across the netherlands according to dtz zadelhoff in part this was because government agencies agreed to let 530 000 sq m of space which partly resulted from a government decision to relocate many of the judicial authorities most parts of the country registered higher demand in 1993 but amsterdam proved to be the most popular office location with take up reaching some 200 000 sq m however these strong take up figures mask the fact that tenants are relinquishing space when they move into new buildings with hardly any net absorption of office space the availability of space rose by 8 per cent to stand at 2 7m sq m agents expect vacancy rates to remain high this year as companies announce cut backs in staffing levels as a result there has been pressure on rents rents on space in some of the most expensive offices in southern amsterdam have fallen by 5 10 per cent elsewhere the pressure from rising vacancy rates has forced landlords to make larger concessions in the form of rent free periods and other incentives although the supply of new space coming on the market has fallen agents do not expect rents to grow in real terms this year hopes are pinned on an improvement in the economy coupled with a reduction in available space which could result in a pick up in rental growth next year\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4233", "title": "ft 11 mar 94 survey of european property 8 rome and

the 1990s lying behind the increasing concern about loans secured against real estate collateral prices of office accommodation have fallen by as much as 50 per cent in the capital albeit weakening

that supply is virtually static in rome s centre vacancy rates of around 5 per cent are half those recorded in the outskirts ministries and public bodies are important in rome s market this may explain the generally low standard of properties most of recent construction has been speculative buildings are not highly specified and are generally not satisfactory for international users says mr trella with about 1m sq m of the 6m sq m total within rome s gra ring road taken by government and other public sector occupants the capital s property market is less sensitive to the recession than elsewhere indeed the figures show that recession and other adverse factors have bitten deeper in milan the other pole in what is essentially a bi polar italian market milan s office stock amounts to about 8 5m sq m vacancy rates are now between 8 and 10 per cent in the centre and between 20 and 25 per cent in the outskirts says mr trella milan s property bubble in which rents and capital values rose by 300 per cent between 1985 and 1990 burst before the more gentle deflation started in the capital the peak was reached at the end of 1990 anticipating the recession s onset and arriving more than two years before the mani pulite magistrates made their first public moves mr trella says annual rents for prime city centre accommodation are now below l550 000 a sq m against l750 000 three years ago nevertheless strict planning policies favouring residential use and preventing the construction of new buildings in milan s centre give a firm base to the property market and as the country s business capital with its stock market leading domestic financial institutions and the head offices of leading industrial companies milan is the natural location choice for foreign companies setting foot in italy at the centre of the country s principal manufacturing areas milan is also close to the country s important trading partners and enjoys good transport connections to the outside and unlike rome which suffers from very poor services milan has reasonable public transport with these positive features it is difficult to envisage the demand for business accommodation shifting from milan to other italian cities yet milan does nothing to promote itself remarks mr paul bacon partner at healey baker s milan office whereas other big business centres actively seek to attract newcomers the lombardy capital does not push itself in addition to its innately strong position perhaps another reason is the shortage of good property there is a lack of quality in the market even in the centre most property is of poor quality inadequate lifts are normal and almost two thirds of buildings do not have air conditioning systems says mr bacon he considers however that opportunities exist for foreign investors companies have been downsizing during the recession and searching for cost saving by reducing office requirements and relocating from the centre to the outskirts this has created investment opportunities prices have dropped by between 30 and 35 per cent from their peaks and milan is now looking cheap compared to other cities observes mr bacon adding that yields have risen from 5 per cent to 6 5 per cent this is an attractive factor for north european investors seeking income flow italian investors tend to buy for capital growth discouraged by political uncertainty and falling prices they have been absent from the market since the end of 1992 mr bacon expects that the property markets in rome and milan will become more like those in other leading european cities with a greater presence of international investors he also believes that italian institutions will align themselves with international practices we are likely to see change in three areas first legislation will lead to the creation of property funds second italian insurance companies will give greater emphasis to yields third italian banks will become more aggressive and the average loan ratio will increase from 50 to 70 per cent predicts mr bacon and when will the market turn up political and economic factors will decide the uncertainty that clouds italian politics will probably not be cleared by the parliamentary elections at the end of march and an upturn in the economy does not seem imminent few would wager that the bottom has been reached in the property

people in dublin its only irish office he agrees that after the dire straits of 1992 1993 the main problem the irish market has to handle now is a lack of good property for the cash rich investor

capital allowance whereby an investor or occupier can offset the entire purchase of a building against profits these inducements were originally due to expire in february 1993 but there was so much

decided to leave it vacant until the paris property market picks up rather than risk selling it now at a depressed price and thereby adding to the existing pressures on commercial property prices in the city centre the government s decision might have been different had the building been suitable for residential use commercial property is still in the doldrums in france but there have in recent months been signs of recovery in the residential sphere the french property business is now anxiously waiting to see whether the pick up in the residential market will spread to the commercial sector thereby marking the end of three gruelling years of recession almost every area of the french economy has been bruised by recession over the past year yet few sectors have been as badly affected as property the market peaked in 1990 when prices soared and the supply of new buildings particularly office space in the golden triangle and la defense districts in paris and the part dieu area of lyon increased dramatically but the market collapsed when the economy came under pressure in the early 1990s the high rate of french real interest rates which have for the past few years been among the steepest in europe prompted companies to cut back on investment and consumers to save rather than spend their money thereby depressing the demand for commercial and residential property alike the demand problem was aggravated in both sectors by the stream of new developments coming on to the market by the beginning of 1993 when france moved into technical recession for the first time since the gulf war the commercial market was further depressed by weak confidence and the escalating rate of business failures the rise in joblessness had a similar effect on the residential sector rentals and purchase prices tumbled in both sectors although the pressure was most acute in the commercial districts of paris and lyon that had fared best during the boom years a recent survey by jones lang wootton estimated that average annual rentals for prime office space in the golden triangle had fallen from ffr4 500 a square metre in the final quarter of 1990 to ffr3 500 by the end of 1993 in la

receiverships which were such a painful feature of the us and uk industries in the early 1990s this is because of the defensive structure of the market whereby the big banks and insurance groups that dominate property ownership step in to support vulnerable companies and to prevent them from collapsing and thus creating a vicious cycle of over supply and declining prices the french recession is

former communist bloc but what gives the czech capital much of its charm can also be the source of much frustration for foreign investors who have to grapple with an antiquated and overloaded telephone network an inordinate amount of red tape uncertain property claims and a scarcity of good quality office space and accommodation not to mention appalling levels of pollution after two years of slow progress following the 1989 velvet revolution that overthrew the communist regime the property market took off in 1992 with demand exceeding supply by 2 1 2 times and causing prices to rocket a two tier market developed with speculative developments mostly refurbishments aimed at extracting the maximum rents from foreigners on the one hand and a czech market with very low prices that had been fixed during the communist period with no reference to market values on the other strict planning and building constraints combined with strong tenancy rights and rent controls exacerbated the shortage of office space and contributed to inflated prices that have made prague more expensive than vienna milan or brussels in 1992 about 30 per cent of property coming on the market was reasonably priced but the rest was well over priced the market got carried away with people selling at german prices says mr robert neale of property consultants healey baker prices peaked at about dm65 for offices in prime site properties at the end of 1992 but have fallen since to dm55 dm60 for the best locations and to about dm50 elsewhere in the early days there was a huge demand but people got frightened off by the high prices now the demand has been scaled down because the economy will not grow as quickly as originally thought says mr alan vincent from consultants richard ellis he believes prices will fall further as companies seek simpler but more functional accommodation price was not the only deterrent for companies looking for a central european location the bulk of the property on offer has been refurbishments and these tend to lack the flexibility and facilities available in new accommodation many were of poor quality richard ellis calculate that roughly 70 per cent of the 12 000 sq m of office space that came on the market in 1992 was refurbished property refurbished accommodation represents 40 per cent of some 43 000 sq m of office space supplied in 1993 and a forecast 40 500 sq m of new office space expected this year most of those refurbishments should have been gutted out unfortunately many people did superficial refurbishments painting over the cracks the market has always been starved of quality space and to some extent it still is says mr neal only a few developments offer high quality the international business centre ibc a joint development by france s caisse des depots and compagnie generale de batiment et de construction is regarded as offering the best accommodation at the moment the 24 000 sq m development was completed last year and more than 70 per cent has been let say healey baker tenants include societe generale johnson johnson and mostly companies with a foreign interest the development is adjacent to the atrium hotel and a large conference centre and while it is slightly off the city centre it is close to the metro line and the north south motorway the charles bridge centre developed by fingroup offers more than 3 000 sq m of mixed use space for offices suites shops and restaurants it is a small development but it has a unique location and views across charles bridge and the river the development consisting of three fully refurbished historical buildings overlooking the vltava river is due to be completed in march office space has been let at dm52 a sq m mostly to foreign companies there are several other small developments under construction or planned around the city centre including some refurbished palaces the biggest project in the centre is on na prikope a mainly pedestrian street where the caisse des depots has bought a site for which it hopes to win planning permission to build 10 000 sq m of shops and 20 000 sq m of offices this is the only large prime site development in the pipeline because of planning restrictions and lack of financing prague missed out on the larger developments seen elsewhere in post communist eastern europe but this may not be such a bad thing in the long term says mr

recession the uk property market is in the throes of a spectacular recovery investors have returned to the property market in strength creating one of the most buoyant market for good quality property since the 1970s the resurgence of the uk property market can be attributed to two factors the strength of the government bond market and the anticipation of a recovery in rental values the most powerful of these stimuli was the sharp fall in bond yields in 1993 when long gilt yields fell from 8 8 per cent to 6 4 per cent as equity and bond yields plummeted the relatively high yields available on property became increasingly attractive to investors more money became available for property from several sources institutions increased their allocations to the sector property companies earmarked new funds for investment from the pounds 2 39bn they raised from rights issues and foreign investors increased their investment in uk property from pounds 1 3bn in 1992 to nearly pounds 2 2bn in 1993 the weight of demand for property sharply drove down property yields on average they fell by 0 8 per cent to 8 2 per cent in the second half of 1993 which is the largest fall over any six month period since 1977 according to hillier parker chartered surveyors the uplift has benefited all sectors of the market but has been particularly marked in the retail sector where yields on some high street shops and retail warehouse parks have fallen to record lows the london office market which was for several years shunned by investors has also staged a remarkable recovery it registered a record annual decline in yields last year when they fell by 1 8 percentage points to 8 3 per cent property yields are expected to continue to move downwards in the view of ubs the brokers it cites the rapid fall of gilt yields which has outpaced the fall in property yields the weight of money available for investment and the likely resumption of rental growth as reasons for expecting average yields to fall throughout 1994 even if gilt yields rise significantly during this period so far the occupational market has made a relatively small contribution to the turnaround in the performance of the property sector although the fall in rental values slowed in the final quarter of 1993 rents continued to decline in december at a rate varying from 2 per cent in the rental market to 10 per cent in the office market according to the investment property databank a research group however the health of the occupational market is improving particularly in cities outside london which suffered less severely from the recession than london and are not burdened with such a large oversupply of space in some parts of the market a gradual recovery of business confidence is already resulting in increased take up an upturn in tenant demand last year pushed the availability of offices in central london down by more than a fifth to stand at 14 per cent of the total stock according to dtz debenham thorpe savills a firm of property advisers believes that rents on top quality london offices are poised for a revival over the next three years it predicts a 15 per cent annual increase in rates for top grade space in the city of london to an average of pounds 46 per square foot in the west end it predicts a 12 per cent annual rise to an average of pounds 51 per sq ft the retail sector is already showing signs of an upturn despite the patchy nature of the recovery in the retail sector the balance between supply and demand has improved as a result of a modest improvement in take up together with a decline in development activity which has fallen since reaching a peak in 1990 these factors have resulted in a fall in shopping centre vacancy rates from 33 per cent to 26 per cent over the past year the industrial property sector is also beginning to improve having registered the first fall in available floorspace since may 1989 king sturge a firm of chartered surveyors believes that the amount of available industrial space dropped by 1 per cent to 180 5m sq ft in the last four months of 1993 a revival in the occupational market will help the recovery of the investment market become more broadly based so far the type of property being sought by investors has been predominantly high quality institutional grade property with secure incomes paid by financially strong tenants but as concern about tenant bankruptcies diminishes investors are placing less emphasis on security and more on the potential for rental growth the extent of the revival of the property market will also depend on the attitude of the banks which are largely responsible for financing second tier properties which do not play a part in institutional portfolios as the rental market improves and the banks willingness to lend to the sector increases the improvement in property values will spread more widely throughout the market\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4240", "title":

from their peak in march 1991 according to jones lang wootton they are now at their lowest levels in real terms since 1986 some common themes run through many of europe s property markets the strong economic upturn in the latter part of the 1980s resulted in increased construction of new buildings which came on stream at a time when the recession had eroded tenant demand as a result vacancy rates have risen rents have fallen and investment yields have come under pressure the difficult economic conditions which have undermined occupational demand in the past couple of years are generally expected to ease somewhat in 1994 although economic growth is expected at best to be limited moreover most established office markets now have a limited supply of new buildings in the pipeline which should help supply and demand come closer to equilibrium but despite the similarities of the influences affecting europe s markets there are marked differences in the structure and state of different markets they are influenced by their legal systems planning laws tax regimes bank lending policies and accessibility to foreign investment as well as their stage of the economic cycle the greatest contrasts are those between the established markets of western europe and the fledgling markets of central and eastern europe which continue to be hampered by legal and financial difficulties in

property funds which have benefited from a large inflow of money ensured that yields stabilised in 1993 and in some cases improved in spain the recession which emerged midway through 1992 drove rents

for the currency is going to come from either way the market is now pricing an element of political risk into the dollar until yesterday foreign exchanges had paid little attention to the whitewater

concern that mr clinton may find himself in a very very difficult situation he added that us institutional holders of dollars had been particularly keen to unload some of their long dollar positions

upwards bet since then however it has weakened by five pfen nigs from the dm1 7340 position where it started the year the dollar has also been undermined by the slow pace of monetary easing by the bundesbank and fears that the us federal reserve will not tighten policy as aggressively as previously anticipated to some observers it is a case of deja vu mr jeremy hawkins senior economic adviser at bank of america said it was back to a year ago when bullishness about the dollar stumbled on the rocks of a slower than anticipated monetary easing from the bundesbank mr hawkins said he viewed the current dip in the dollar as a temporary and perhaps necessary correction given the extent to which the market had been long of dollars the carrying cost of holding dollar assets on a one month view there is a 2 5 per cent interest rate differential in favour of the d mark over the dollar also bites deeper when the outlook for the currency being held is called more into question the bank of

losses of at least dollars 206m 0 5 per cent of chile s gdp those rumblings which have already claimed the jobs of eight executives threaten to continue for months or even years to come there are already suggestions that public condemnation of codelco s management team considered arrogant and unaccountable might hamper mr villarzu s room for manoeuvre to solve its problems what codelco needs is an aggressive management not a conservative cautious one says a former company executive but if you are being attacked by everyone all the time no one will be able to move on the other hand the futures scandal has provided ample ammunition for those seeking drastic reform even privatisation of what they regard as a state dinosaur in a report entitled codelco the errors of a giant the right wing liberty institute argues that lack of control over futures trading was symptomatic of codelco s unwieldy structure even before the futures fiasco the incoming administration of president elect eduardo frei had committed itself to decentralisation and the creation of a holding company last month mr villarzu scrapped the vice presidency responsible for mediation between the santiago headquarters and its six divisions he ordered the establishment of divisional administrative councils to strengthen decision making at that level the role of codelco s politically appointed board apparently so far removed from day to day decisions that it was unaware of the company s speculative activities is also to be examined pending too is the issue of codelco s contribution to the armed forces which creams off 10 per cent of returns from copper sales modernisation is necessary mr villarzu says because costs have been going up systematically for many years during 17 years of military government codelco did not develop a single new deposit the life blood of any mining company although codelco which produces 12 per cent of the world s copper provides chile with a fifth of its foreign exchange earnings its importance to the domestic economy has diminished falling ore grades rising costs and an appreciating peso have chipped away at the company s treasury contribution although annual production has remained at about 1 2m tonnes transfers to the state shrank from dollars 1 96bn in 1989 to dollars 891m in 1992 in 1994 that figure could dwindle to just dollars 30m according to mr jose pablo arellano budget minister to stop the rot codelco desperately needs to add a high grade low cost mine to its ageing quartet mr villarzu has however rejected suggestions that a law permitting joint ventures with the private sector should be extended to the development of so called replacement deposits we don t see the necessity of insisting on this we believe codelco can exploit such reserves on its own he says but it is unclear where the money for this will come from any hope that the finance ministry which sets codelco s investment budget will provide the estimated dollars 400m for radomiro tomic a deposit with annual production potential of 150 000 tonnes have been severely dented the government which is committed to social spending may find it politically untenable to divert precious resources to a state company that has just gambled away millions of dollars of taxpayers money neither does the joint venture alternative now look so unequivocally attractive the great fanfare over the commitment of cyprus amax lac minerals to pay dollars 555m for a 51 per cent stake of the el abra deposit has died down following serious delays to contract signing mr villarzu may have to seek alternative solutions much discussed has been the possibility of selling codelco s non core activities such as the rancagua workshop or the 530mw thermo electric power station at tocapilla believed to be worth dollars 600m another idea not included in recent capital markets legislation is to allow codelco to borrow cash for new projects from chile s private pension funds which have assets of dollars 16bn bringing new deposits on stream is only one task mr villarzu is also committed to lowering production costs at existing mines which average 69 cents a pound compared with an estimated 55 60 cents at the country s private mines this year s target is to trim production costs by 3 cents groundwork has been prepared by the previous management which managed to halt if not reverse the seemingly inexorable rise in costs this was achieved by gradual staff cuts to 22 000 from 27 000 in 1988 contracting out peripheral activities a crackdown on absenteeism and freezing wages and productivity bonuses all this has further soured relations with union leaders who blame management negligence for the futures fiasco and they are likely to regard the break up of codelco as a surreptitious step towards privatisation but codelco is no ordinary company and privatisation is a word few dare utter openly mr villarzu is implacable i am not in favour of privatising codelco he says i am not in favour of privatising any state copper company for him the ultimate goal is clear to transform codelco into one of the world s most profitable mining companies but to achieve this there will have to be some drastic changes mr villarzu may yet have a surprise or two up his sleeve\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4253", "title": "ft 11 mar 94 commodities and

due to meet at the australian coal industry council on monday a tripartite discussion forum brokered by mr david beddall the federal resources minister on the union side there is a demand for an inquiry into pricing and underlying this a long standing suggestion that australia should negotiate its annual coal contracts with the all important japanese buyers on a collective not an individual company basis coal after all is the country s biggest export and over 40 per cent goes to japan if the buyers are working as a cartel doesn t it make sense for suppliers to do likewise from the companies side comes a warning that even an inquiry of this nature could send damaging signals to customers if anything is to emerge says mr denis porter at the new south wales coal association it should be a review which looks more broadly at obstacles to growth in the industry s efficiency not a witch hunt into pricing the unusual aspect to this spat is that parts of the financial community

was not a well thought out marketing effort there didn t seem to be much co ordination between producers when the japanese offered something ridiculous they got frightened the coking coal agreements

dollar terms for hard coking coal and around 8 to 8 5 per cent for soft this was the fourth successive year that coking coal prices had fallen and even producers admitted they were shocked by the size of the 1994 drop coal shares tumbled bhp defended the deal on the grounds that canadian producers despite their cost disadvantage were waiting to snap up market share more generally producers pointed to the enormous problems confronting the japanese steel mills at present and to longer term developments in steel making technology which mitigate against much upturn in coking coal demand no one not even the unions denies the buyers parlous situation but the industry s critics point out that the japanese are adept at picking off large producers who will take bigger price cuts by offering them more attractive tonnages in a business with high fixed costs this can be persuasive but it can also spell big problems leading to downsizing and lost jobs for the smaller producers who are then obliged to mop up at the very least critics think the system could be shaken up price negotiations for steaming coal where underlying prospects are brighter than for coking coal could go ahead of coking coal perhaps the coal companies could pay more early attention to other asian buyers instead of being fixated with japan more speculatively the notion of establishing a coal equivalent of the

bond futures mr jorg franke dtb chairman said the buxl future had been launched to meet increased demand for long dated debt especially from international investors the rise in issuance at this part of the yield curve has shown that there is a real need for long dated bonds in the cash market and a hedging instrument was needed to round off the picture he said since december 1993 germany has issued dm27bn of 22 year and 30 year bonds despite some concern over the liquidity of the underlying market most are confident that the bundesbank s commitment to reinforcing frankfurt s position as a financial centre will ensure a steady supply i expect to see at least one 30 year bond every six months that s not a lot but enough said mr peter kerger head of futures and options at natwest markets in frankfurt volatility in the 10 year bund future has jumped sharply following recent market turbulence and an even longer dated instrument is likely to be even more volatile it s not the easiest instrument to trade but if we want to be an international market we have to offer these types of products said mr lemster moreover said mr franke the contract would offer cash investors a way to hedge their very long dated positions during turbulent market conditions while providing short term traders with a speculative instrument the fibor future may be slower to take off largely because liffe already lists a similar contract based on the british bankers association interest settlement rate for three month euromark deposits the fibor future could be a flop said one dealer noting that duplicating another exchange s products has never worked moreover he feels that there is not enough fibor based business around to justify creating a fibor contract but others say that is precisely why it is needed once the fibor future is in place it could spur the development of more fibor based instruments said mr franke some fear the underlying market may not be broad enough without issuance of short term government paper but hopes for such debt were dashed yesterday when bundesbank council member johann wilhelm gaddum said the issuance of treasury bills could interfere with the central

slow start further impetus may come from a special session today of the general agreement on tariffs and trade s governing council to discuss the matter though ministers are due to approve the work

a comprehensive work programme on trade environment and sustainable development should be put to ministers when they meet to sign the final package of trade liberalising accords informal consultations since then suggest broad agreement on the need to set up a committee to carry out the work however its mandate and lifespan remain controversial no one disputes the need for gatt and its successor the world trade organisation to confront the way in which trade and environment policies interact and may conflict there is nevertheless a wide gulf between the views of environmentalists who favour changing gatt rules to facilitate the use of trade restrictions for environmental protection and those of developing countries who fear that moves to green the gatt may spread a virulent new form of protectionism there has thus been strong resistance among developing countries to presenting the marrakesh meeting with a fixed agenda which is bound they believe to reflect rich world concerns instead they want the marrakesh declaration to confine itself to approving the principles guiding the committee s work and for the committee to decide its own agenda in its own time creating a

principles underlying the work programme were outlined by uruguay round participants in a statement last december they include the need to promote sustainable development preserve the open trading system and avoid unilateralism while ensuring the responsiveness of the trading system to environmental objectives there should not be nor need be any policy contradiction between upholding and safeguarding an open non discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system on the one hand and acting for the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development on the

around the world last week backed proposals calling for an action oriented agenda aimed at reaching recommendations within two years conscious of the sensitivities of developing countries the proposals stress support for sustainable development and down play the role of trade restrictions at the same time however the gatt wto is urged to address the two issues which most raise third world hackles the first relates to so called processing and production methods ppms environmentalists want gatt rules changed to allow discrimination between identical products produced in different ways

allegedly gained by countries with low environmental standards mr charles arden clarke of the wwf world wide fund for nature insists that there is no intention to oblige poor countries to adopt the high environmental standards of rich ones rather he says the issue turns on the more general need to make product prices reflect full environmental costs but the suspicion remains that in practice eco dumping will serve as a new pretext for protectionism aimed primarily at poor countries other agenda ideas are less controversial for the last two years a gatt working group chaired by mr hidetoshi

the bank played a crucial part in mexico s decision to join gatt in 1986 the restructuring of its external debt in 1989 and the redesign of environmental policy two years ago bank economists were powerful and successful advocates of the liberalisation of mexico s agriculture sector the bank has now prepared a restricted circulation report on the economic challenges mexico faces in the 1990s while largely praising economic policy to date the bank calls for a sweeping overhaul of mexico s legal system and important reforms in the labour and financial sectors environmental policy and provision of public infrastructure the bank is worried about mexico s slow economic growth and low savings rate which it believes makes its economy over dependent on foreign capital it concludes that the high current account deficit and modest improvements in productivity raise concern about the sustainability of economic growth the low economic growth is largely attributed to the substitution of foreign goods for domestically produced goods this it believes is a result of the low competitiveness of mexican companies partly because their old technologies have become obsolete and new investment has replaced existing capital stock rather than adding to it specifically the bank calls for further economic reform in four areas to remove constraints on economic growth the report is highly critical of mexico s legal system concluding that weaknesses in the commercial law framework and the mechanism for the resolution of disputes constitute important constraints to private sector development the report recommends new laws on secured transactions which would make it easier for banks to take possession of property when a borrower has defaulted such a reform should lower mexico s high financing costs a principal complaint of mexican companies the bank says the resolution of disputes through the courts is a lengthy costly and unpredictable process it blames this in part on an unacceptable level of competence and integrity of the judges especially in the local court system suggestions for reform are vague but include a national training institute for judicial personnel and the establishment of an authentic civil service in courts at state and federal levels it proposes reforms to encourage the provision of binding private sector dispute resolutions the bank says mexico faces two key labour challenges increasing the quality of its work force and establishing a flexible labour market on the first the report says the problem is the low and disparate quality of the educational system and especially of basic education the failure of mexican companies to train workers sufficiently holds back productivity growth mexico s labour market is regulated by antiquated labour law that makes it costly to dismiss workers exhorts companies to promote according to seniority rather than ability and makes it difficult to move workers between jobs the bank reports however the bank says the main problem is not exactly the law but agreements companies have reached with unions the law allows for some flexibility but how much depends on the ability of management to win concessions from the unions on infrastructure the bank approves of the government s move to let the private sector build and finance toll roads electricity plants water systems and provide telecommunications but is critical of the way the policy has been carried out the bank calls for more competition or regulation where that is not possible in the provision of infrastructure it says the manner in which toll road concessions have been granted needs to be improved further deregulation and privatisation is needed in railways and an independent regulator should be established in both telecommunications and the electricity market to prevent monopoly abuses on environmental policy the bank describes the government s threat of closing polluting plants as costly ineffective and arbitrary since it gives the government too much discretion in responding to businesses environmental violations instead it says the government should rely more as it is now doing on mandatory fines for lack of compliance it recommends economic incentives such as taxes on polluting inputs and outputs and higher prices on natural resources rather than command and control regulations as a way of improving the environment overall the world bank says mexico has been a pioneer in private sector led development and gives the government high marks for stabilising the economy however it evidently

responsibility for health social welfare and education with these two envelopes making up close to 80 per cent of total federal spending no meaningful assault on the deficit is possible until the reforms are in place financial markets are expected to take today s budget in their stride there s no reason for anyone to be surprised says mr ted carmichael senior economist at burns fry a toronto securities firm domestic and foreign investors are more unsettled for the time being by ottawa s monetary policies uncertainty on this front has been heightened by three recent developments the first rise in us short term interest rates in five years the appointment from february 1 of a new governor of the bank of canada and mr martin s tendency to ruminate about interest rates in public mr martin and the new bank governor mr gordon thiessen have a strong incentive to keep canadian interest rates falling canada is pulling out of recession far more slowly than the us the economy is growing at an annual rate of only about 3 per cent compared to more than 5 per cent in the us the traditional gap between us and canadian interest rates is already at its narrowest in more than a decade the gap on three month treasury bills is only 33 basis points compared to a peak of 600 points in early 1990 the spread on 30 year bonds is currently 80 basis points the question in the minds of traders investors and policy makers is whether there is room for this gap to narrow still further or even to disappear without causing the canadian dollar to nosedive inflation in canada is expected to be no more than about 1 per cent this year about half the rate in the us even so mr martin sent the dollar into a spin this month when he suggested that the rise in us rates might bring canadian rates below those south of the border his comments were immediately followed by a rise in short term rates to protect the currency bank of nova scotia economists noted in a recent commentary the central bank may have little choice but to sanction higher rates and spreads if currency pressures continue despite the impressive inflation performance the markets have yet to take the measure of mr martin and mr thiessen although the new governor is reputed to be a dedicated inflation fighter he has yet to establish the credibility of his predecessor mr john crow similarly mr martin and his counterparts in the provinces whose combined deficits are even bigger than the federal government s have not convinced the markets that their deficit cutting actions will match their words until they do economists predict that canadian interest rates will reach us levels only at the expense of a further slide in the canadian dollar\n"}, {"id": "FT941-8040", "title": "ft 22 feb 94 pakistani troops free child

will be set against the background of a far stronger economic performance last year than had been expected according to official figures published yesterday the singapore economy grew 9 9 per cent in 1993 the biggest increase since 1988 and a sharp acceleration from the 6 per cent growth of the previous year fiscal deficits are virtually unknown in singapore and there is little in the country s recent economic performance or near term prospects which could give mr hu cause for serious concern the surge in growth last year was due mainly to a big increase in activity in the financial services sector with rapid bank loan growth combined with a sharp increase in stock market turnover the financial and business services sector grew 13 per cent last year more than double the growth rate in 1992 but there was also an unexpectedly big jump in manufacturing activity with overall manufacturing output increasing 9 8 per cent in 1993 against 2 5 per cent in the previous year singapore s electronics industry which produces half the world s output of disk drives as well as many other computer peripherals benefited from the us recovery and a computer price war in many export markets mr

growth the government would appear to have little to worry about on the inflation front singapore s consumer price index rose 2 4 per cent last year a marginal increase on 1992 this year will see a one time blip in inflation caused by the introduction of a 3 per cent general sales tax gst in april expected to add 2 5 per cent to the consumer price index the government which oversees foreign exchange reserves of more than dollars 40bn pounds 27bn controls inflation primarily through currency market intervention to help a steady appreciation of the singapore dollar mr hu says foreign capital inflows particularly into the stock market in effect mean government policy not to internationalise the local currency has been relaxed somewhat but he says our fundamentals are strong enough to avoid destabilising flows also warding off an over heated economy are domestic interest rates which had already begun to edge up before the us federal reserve tightened the monetary reins earlier

central bank said that from next monday the minimum capital requirement for new banks would be increased to rbs2bn pounds 868 000 at the market rate from a present threshold of rbs100m existing banks as well as those which manage to get a licence by next monday will be given until january 1995 to increase their capital to rbs2bn from 1999 the minimum capital requirement for all players will rise to a european union threshold of ecu5m pounds 3 78m mr tulin said the aim was to protect depositors reduce money laundering through the banking sector and help banks compete internationally exempt from the new requirement would be agricultural co operative banks which the authorities want to establish in the russian countryside and which would keep the rbs100m threshold another threshold of rbs500m would be established for banks which did not take deposits from the population with inflation of around 20 per cent a month unchanged minimum capital requirements have made it increasingly easy to start a bank a situation where entrepreneurs face the choice of either buying a good car or setting up a bank is paradoxical and abnormal mr tulin told a news conference despite the fact that many of russia s 2 000 banks are small and under capitalised many of the threats to russian banking come from larger banks in particular those owed lots of money by ailing enterprises which also happen to be their shareholders other problems are institutional including a shortage of tools for assessing project risk and recovering loans mr andrei tsumailo vice president of most bank one of russia s big private commercial banks hailed the plan s 1999 target as a reasonable long term goal but he believed that in the shorter term many banks shareholders such as ailing industrial enterprises would be unable to raise the necessary capital at best such companies would have to divert funds earmarked for investment in an economy which is under capitalised in every sector mr tulin said banks which could not meet the new requirements would either have to merge with bigger institutions or fold the central bank last year withdrew the licences of 19 banks many of which met its

through the swiss alps italy and germany which depend heavily on the gotthard pass for the transport of goods said they would seek talks within the eu to consider the implications there were worries in brussels yesterday that the swiss vote in a referendum on sunday could scupper chances of the eu reaching an agreement with austria on lorry traffic through its alpine passes this has been an obstacle in the negotiations on austrian entry to the eu due to start their final stage today germany warned that closer ties between the eu and switzerland would suffer because of the vote to ban foreign road transit within 10 years the decision was supported by nearly 52 per cent of those who took part in defiance of the swiss government s campaign against a ban italy called for an urgent meeting of eu transport ministers warning that the decision had set a dangerous precedent and could have a serious knock on effect in other countries france spain and the netherlands also demanded a tough eu response about 1 000 foreign trucks a day cut through switzerland along the gotthard pass which bisects the country north to south the swiss government had argued in its campaign against the ban that a 12 year accord with the eu restraining heavy traffic provided adequate protection eu and swiss negotiators recently agreed that switzerland could maintain its 28 tonne limit and a ban on trucks using roads at night and weekends this agreement may be undermined by the vote provoking retaliatory measures yesterday representatives of the italian road hauliers association said the annual cost of the swiss ban would be l750bn pounds 300m in extra mileage alone they calculate journeys will be 400km longer on average mr raffaele costa italian transport minister said yesterday even if the swiss are talking of introducing these measures over a period of 10 years to allow plans for alternative transport matters will not be easy if not impossible he also pointed out that environmental considerations already made transalpine traffic difficult in bonn the transport ministry said the acceptance of the alp initiative campaign against transit traffic makes the negotiations with the eu considerably more difficult the german association of long haul carriers denounced the move as a further step for switzerland on its way towards isolation in europe the move would lead to traffic problems in france austria and in the southern german state of baden wurttemberg the association said it would lobby brussels to threaten switzerland with reciprocal measures for swiss trucks such as forcing them to use railways only however germany s opposition social democrats welcomed the swiss move as a victory for environmental policy and bund the german association for the protection of nature said the ban represented a milestone toward resolving the ecological problems of the alps austria believes the swiss decision will strengthen its hand in negotiations for eu entry mr viktor klima transport minister said austrian voters would support entry only if a 12 year transit treaty with the eu due to run until 2004 remained intact the treaty restricts lorry traffic through austria

agreement with the union the stoppage seems aimed at financially stable companies primarily in machine tools union members will be balloted between march 1 and 3 the decision to postpone further

striking feature of the danish french and dutch pig production systems is the degree of producer co operation normally encouraged by respective governments this provides strong links between producers processors and retailers improved power when buying supplies and an ability to negotiate advantageous loans whereas almost 100 per cent of pig production in denmark france and netherlands is covered by collaborative arrangements the coverage for britain is only about 40 per cent the report says a british ban on the use of sow tethers and stalls in 1999 will bring extra costs for producers

cuts announced recently by brazil s paranapanema the world s largest tin company is not expected not lead to an equivalent reduction in its exports this year because of purchases of tin ore from wildcat miners despite paranapanema s denials market analysts expect the company to increase these purchases particularly if international tin prices continue to recover paranapanema announced on february 3 that it would cut its production of tin concentrate by 45 to 50 per cent from 12 955 tonnes last year to between 6 500 and 7 000 this year in an attempt to reduce world tin stocks conserve its own reserves and push up prices the company made two cuts of 10 per cent each last year in response to falling international tin prices it said the cut would contribute to bringing down world tin stocks from 41 000 tonnes at the end of last year to 22 000 by the end of this year the production cut which paranapanema says represents about 3 5 per cent of estimated world tin demand this year will be concentrated at the company s pitinga mine in the amazon which has traditionally accounted for more than 90 per cent of the company s production and half of brazil s ms adriana franca an analyst at the brazilian subsidiary of london based broker wi carr says paranapanema wants to maintain its reserves at its pitinga mine until prices are higher and increase its purchases of tin ore from wildcat miners mr arislando prado paranapanema market relations director said in a written statement that the decision had nothing to do with the unexpected resignation of company president dr samuel hanan at the end of last year dr hanan is still working with paranapanema as a consultant and resigned as president for personal reasons according to the company in addition to pitinga paranapanema owns half of the ebesa joint venture which buys ore from wildcat miners at the bom futuro site in rondonia state last year paranapanema s share of ebesa production was about 4 000 tonnes ms franca says she has been told by paranapanema that its purchases from bom futuro via ebesa will increase by 1 000 tonnes and she calculates that the company s exports will therefore be reduced by about 30 per cent the local media has also reported paranapanema s intention to increase purchases from wildcat miners however the company is now denying that any increase is planned mr heinz feldenheimer a sao paulo based tin trader says he expects higher prices to attract more wildcat miners to bom futuro and that paranapanema will increase its purchases substantially for paranapanema it makes sense because they don t have to invest or risk anything they just buy from the independent miners mr feldenheimer also expects the recovering world tin price to spur brazilian companies to export more this year than last even though its quota agreed with the association of tin producing countries last october is lower although brazil is not a member of the organisation it has agreed to an export quota of 20 175 tonnes this year compared with 24 000 last year because of the closed nature of paranapanema and its dominance of the brazilian tin sector accurate production and export statistics are difficult to obtain the brazilian tin producers association whose president is a paranapanema official refuses to comment on the company s cuts and the association says that it cannot yet release figures for brazil s tin concentrate exports last year however preliminary data from the association puts last year s production at 21 000 tonnes of which 15 000 tonnes was exported far below the 24 000 tonne quota this raises questions about paranapanema s stated production of 17 000 tonnes last year which includes ebesa production according to ms franca 98 per cent of the company s production is for export and that would mean that paranapanema and its share of ebesa exceeded brazil s total tin exports mr feldenheimer speculates that the company could have retained stocks last year because of the low prices which hit dollars 4 600 per tonne in september since then the london metal exchange three months delivery tin price has recovered to over dollars 5 600 a tonne partly because of the atpc agreement and producers are hoping that it will reach dollars 6 500 by the end of the year other tin companies are not expected to increase production to compensate for

short term respite and is urging farm ministers to agree further production curbs this year mr rene steichen agriculture commissioner recently warned that the drop in beef stocks has not so much been caused by reform but has to be explained by the cyclical movement of production he fears that the market will not remain so positive but will move into imbalance caused by over production in one to two years mr steichen is calling for prompt action to make adjustments to the beef regime in a calm environment rather than in an emergency situation as has all too often been the case in the past his calls are backed by the uk government which wants to trim spending on beef the second most expensive support system in the agricultural budget beaten only by cereals the commission is proposing adjustments to beef premium payments and is hoping that reforms already in place will reduce the role played by intervention it s days are numbered as a real outlet and we hope it will end up as what it was always intended to be a last resort a commission official explains instead of acting as a safety net to keep farmers producing beef the intervention system encouraged over production and the eu still raises far more beef than it needs ireland for example produces seven times its own beef consumption with about 75 per cent usually going straight to intervention stores some farmers were producing heavyweight carcasses that had no commercial market and were going straight into intervention a uk farming official says the irony about the support system is that the beef is often sold years after it is bought at a price that is not high enough to cover the costs of keeping it in cold storage about pounds 2 30 a tonne each week intervention beef hit the headlines in the uk last year

though his beef is a mere 18 months old outside meat is murder is scrawled on a wall cap reforms are starting to bite into the intervention system and will have an effect on overall beef production

intervention price which is set each year this level will be cut to 60 per cent at the same time the eu has set gradually falling ceilings for the amount of meat that can be bought by intervention boards each year this year 650 000 tonnes can be put into store falling to 350 000 tonnes by 1997 it has also restricted the size of carcasses that can be bought the commission can take action on its own to limit further the size of animals that can be bought by intervention as a way of reducing stocks but if the eu s beef regime is to fit in with the requirements of the general agreement on

consumers through the profound changes in high street shopping he has pioneered as founder of daiei japan s only national supermarket chain mr nakauchi predicts the prices of most goods sold in his supermarkets will halve to us levels in dollar terms but this will take almost 20 years japan s retail market has already become free enough for deregulation to gain its own momentum pushed by foreign competition he believes daiei which started life as a corner store in 1957 has led a slow campaign against countless middlemen suppliers and sometimes bureaucracy to nibble away at japan s notoriously high prices and introduce new ways of shopping its innovations include japan s first own brands in 1978 and the first wholesale warehouse club outside the us opened in kobe 18 months ago while daiei is not the heaviest discounter in today s price battles in japanese retailing it led the first rounds of the war its acquisition last year of three regional supermarket chains has speeded up the rationalisation of japan s overcrowded retail industry eroding the dominance of the small corner store which forms a picturesque but overpriced staple of urban community life like his shops mr nakauchi s personal style challenges the run of the mill the corridor outside his office for example is lined with 75 historic cash registers instead of the badly hung impressionist masterpieces usually found in tokyo corporate headquarters the difference in style expresses a difference in conviction unlike most of his colleagues in the keidanren business federation devoted to defending the interests of big industrial producers mr nakauchi made his fortune by pursuing consumers interests he got his first job after the war in his father s small town chemist shop and founded the first small shop of his own outside a railway station in osaka rather than joining the bottom rung of the salaryman s corporate ladder the usual way to the top mr nakauchi befriended mr hosokawa after daiei bought melons and grapes from kumamoto prefecture during the future prime minister s period as governor there from 1983 to 1991 daiei s patronage was a valuable boon to kumamoto since the nearly 10 000 stores it owns or manages under its own and other names take a 4 per cent to 5 per cent national market share in most products daiei s turnover of just over y2 000bn dollars 19bn in the year to last february on which it made y24bn taxable profit makes it slightly larger than sainsbury the uk supermarket chain this might explain why the equally straight talking mr hosokawa turned to mr nakauchi for advice on deregulation in the retailing industry mr nakauchi s report pointed out that japan s chain stores would save nearly y52bn annually if the government scrapped the 42 permits required to open a supermarket why asked mr nakauchi s report is it necessary to have separate permits to sell meat milk tofu and soft ice cream another is needed to operate a dry cleaning service and yet another to sell thermometers small shopkeepers have staunchly opposed deregulation since the web of rules has provided them with valuable protection from competition until recently they were helped by their ties with the liberal democratic party which ran japan for an unbroken 38 years until its election defeat last july the break up of the ldp is one factor to lighten small retailers former political clout another says mr nakauchi is the ageing of the current generation of shopkeepers unlike mr nakauchi s two sons both senior managers in daiei ambitious young people now see no future in joining their shopkeeping parents business he says all this points to dramatic change in the high street mr nakauchi believes half of japan s 1 5m shops will go out of business it will in line with his theory of gradual change be a slow process taking until the middle of next century but it will be inevitable says mr nakauchi he cannot see how japan s retailing industry can sustain twice as many shops per head 12 for every 1 000 people as the us neighbourhood retailers will then broadly divide into supermarkets and convenience stores so long as they are really convenient he says daiei itself neatly captures both sides of mr nakauchi s vision of retailing with 225 daiei supermarkets and nearly 5 000 lawson convenience stores he dismisses suggestions that the social cost of closing 750 000 shops will create a backlash the process will take such a long time perhaps 50 years the lost jobs will be mopped up by service and leisure businesses mr nakauchi predicts again the shape of daiei s own business deliberately reflects this with its investments in hotels consumer finance and even a baseball stadium to house mr nakauchi s own team the fukuoka daiei hawks contrary to some other businessmen s attempts to dabble in field sports daiei s baseball projects are turning a healthy profit despite the recession and the hawks poor performance in the professional leagues mr

strategy of a group which will soon come to the market with a capitalisation of about pounds 25m trafficmaster is a luton based company which claims to offer the world s first commercially available on board traffic monitoring system a dashboard mounted screen advises of upcoming traffic jams and road accidents in time for drivers to alter their route mr david martell chief executive said monday mornings were the worst time to travel on the uk s motorways while friday mornings were best in all parts of the country he said cynically i think this is because salesmen don t work on fridays they play golf trafficmaster has installed infra red sensors which monitor traffic speed transmit it by radio to a central computer and then feed the information to visual display units in subscribers vehicles the complete network is updated every three minutes and advises motorists of the average speed and direction of any hold up the system already covers more than 1 000 miles of motorways and trunk roads in the south of england and the midlands part of the flotation proceeds will be used to extend the network to cover the main motorways in england wales and scotland by the end of this year and main trunk roads during 1995 and 1996 trafficmaster units can be rented for pounds 30 a month or pounds 19 50 a month if purchased the screens currently cost pounds 199 but like other electronic products prices are likely to fall rapidly if and when they start being sold by high street retailers mr martell 45 is an accountant with interests in property and wine shipping he said the idea for trafficmaster came to him when sitting in an m25 traffic jam on the way to heathrow with an old school friend mr ian williams who is now a non executive director of the company they founded mr martell is a fan of motorways and believes some of the critical press coverage about them is undeserved however he was struck by the poor quality of information about traffic conditions available to drivers the company was established in 1988 and backed by hambro venture capital funds developed the necessary dedicated hardware and software a pilot scheme covering 250 miles of motorways around london was successfully concluded in 1992 after which the company was awarded a 12 year licence to operate the system on all english motorways and trunk roads the licence is non exclusive and mr martell acknowledges that other organisations might seek to enter the market however he believes the company s investment means it has a four year technological lead and a window of opportunity to market its product to date trafficmaster is still incurring trading losses but has installed about 2 000 screens it is close to break even at that level but further investment on extending the network will raise that hurdle however once the network is complete revenue from each additional subscriber should make profitability climb quickly trafficmaster said that existing subscribers which include mainly senior employees from 55 of the ft se 100 companies report that the system helps save time reduces frustration and provides insurance against delay there seems little danger of diminishing demand the confederation of british industry estimates that traffic congestion now costs the uk pounds 15bn a year according to department of transport forecasts the number of vehicles in the uk will grow by 60 per cent by 2020 and road usage will more than double in the same period trafficmaster has patents pending in 48 countries in the us where trafficmaster is a registered trade mark westinghouse electric the us conglomerate has signed an exclusive agreement to introduce the system probably starting on washington dc s beltway about 20 per cent of current subscribers pay extra to use the system as a personal pager a new generation of screens will use smart card technology to provide extra services such as demonstrating each user s position and sending local information and routing from motorway sites so far the company has installed giant trafficmaster screens at 20 welcome break motorway sites with plans for 25 more at ports and airports this year each site can generate more than pounds 18 000 from advertising and also acts as a strong marketing tool to potential subscribers the screens have also been installed in the reception area of several corporate customers so staff can

private companies since 1989 allied lyons has been able to take advantage of a 1 per cent holding in the privately owned company to distribute its alcohol products in the fiercely competitive japanese market in turn suntory has taken a 4 3 per stake in allied lyons worth about pounds 230m at yesterday s market price under the 40 year joint venture agreement signed in 1989 the two groups agreed to set up distribution and marketing companies in japan allied lyons owns 51 per cent of the distribution group and 49 per cent of the marketing company with suntory holding the remainder the osaka based group sells allied lyons products in its home market while the uk company distributes some suntory products in north america such links are rare because japanese companies have usually opted for outright control in the uk often starting from greenfield sites toyota and nissan have built their own car plants for example these investors may feel vindicated after the treatment meted out to honda but fears of a backlash against japanese investment in the uk seems unlikely given the japanese preference for local ownership most importantly they regard the uk as a vital manufacturing base to break into european markets it is unthinkable therefore that they might run away at the first hint of trouble the priority given by japanese companies to employee and trading relationships with component suppliers has meant that a lot of time and money has been committed during the last decade to establishing a large presence in the uk in fact the commitment in many areas is deepening as japanese manufacturers have gone beyond seeing the uk simply as a cheap production country and a way to avoid trade friction when selling into european union markets komatsu the construction equipment producer manufactures hydraulic excavators for the european market from its factory in birtley near newcastle when the plant began production in 1987 it was producing machines to japanese designs it now has its own uk design team making birtley the first komatsu overseas plant to manufacture non japanese designed models yamazaki the world s largest producer of computer controlled machine tools also began manufacturing in the uk in 1987 supplying european markets the range of products built at the worcester plant is now being expanded to serve world markets instead of just europe an example of high yen effect is nsk bearings in peterlee county durham which recently secured its first orders from east asia supplying bearings to white goods manufacturers in china and indonesia these previously had been supplied by nsk s parent in japan japanese property and construction companies which also established wholly owned operations in the uk have fared less well companies like kumagai

necessarily present a significant setback for the uk carmaker", "body": "a critical question faces rover group how will it survive without honda s technology and expertise in the wake of their failed relationship rover has 2 000 design development and engineering staff it has the capability to take a car from first concept on a computer screen to production with no outside help this capability includes the design development and production of engines and gearboxes senior rover executives insist that this capability has not been utilised to the full during the period of rover s 15 year partnership with honda for straightforward commercial reasons rather than for any lack of technical ability there is no logic they maintain in rover developing wholly separate vehicles or powertrains for market slots that can be occupied perfectly adequately by shared development models enjoying good economies of scale and rover s full technical capability will in any case be amply demonstrated in new as yet secret models already scheduled for production and in which honda has played no part according to mr john towers rover s chief executive that such core expertise has been retained by rover is easily overlooked however given that the uk car maker being sold to bmw appears to have been so overwhelmingly dependent on honda two of rover s key model ranges the 600 and 200 400 saloons are the subject of simple licensing agreements with honda or are joint developments while a key rover gearbox is also a honda design made under licence all the licence agreements can be terminated by honda at three months notice mr bernd pischetsrieder bmw s chairman has indicated that bmw will be more than willing to place some of bmw s own 6 000 engineers at rover s disposal as future new model plans develop without honda 6 000 bmw engineers i don t know what we d do with them said one rover executive yesterday we are fully capable of seeing through our new car projects where rover executives and engineers many of whom regret the loss of honda as a long term partner do see major benefits in bmw s ownership is in the finan cial resources that they expect to be made avail able currently rover spends some pounds 200m a year on new model development bringing cars into production and upgrading or maintaining plant and equipment to build them this is a very small amount by mainstream motor industry standards and mr pischetsrieder has indicated that he would expect to see rover increase it to at least 7 per cent of its pounds 4 3bn of annual sales or slightly more than pounds 300m a year that would give rover the ability to bring to fruition various new model ideas which have been beyond its financial grasp all car makers have more model ideas than finance and so have to prioritise what is actually built the company said yesterday rover s design research development and engineering facilities are more extensive than many realise they are concentrated at canley near birmingham and at a vast 900 acre complex including 26 miles of test track at gaydon in warwickshire the gaydon facility currently employing 900 engineers and the subject of a pounds 100m plus new building programme includes climatic wind tunnels prototype build centre structural analysis facilities electro magnetic compatibility centre to test car computer and wiring systems component test laboratories noise vibration and harshness analysis centre engine test beds and anechoic sound free chambers it contains within it the capability to develop engines from scratch it is where rover s state of the art k series multi valve engine was developed and which in turn is being developed from a small capacity four cylinder unit into a full range of engines including a v6 capable of powering almost any vehicle rover might make in the future commercial logic once again dictates however that bmw and other manufacturers units are used instead in some applications such as diesels where they can be simply taken off the shelf peugeot diesels for example are used in rover 200 400 and metro ranges the canley centre is occupied by some 1 000 designers and engineers where vehicles are styled from scratch and where a master database of dimensions and other elements is created off which rover s and component suppliers project engineers can work however one of the most valuable benefits rover has gained from its long relationship with honda has been how to break down old barriers between the various development departments and use simultaneous engineering to bring products to market more quickly and with many fewer mistakes in the build up to production honda has changed rover s methodology radically to the extent that new vehicle projects are not even centred at gardon or canley but at the plant where they are to be built for the 600 for example a project leader was appointed at the cowley manufacturing plant he appointed a team and they lived within just one room while ideas for the car took shape gaydon and canley personnel simply became part of the project team it is this honda taught approach to development costs and quality which allowed rover to take its discovery four wheel drive model into production in a record breaking 21 months and is where rover executives acknowledge rover s greatest debt to honda lies understandably perhaps honda is not anxious to see it all handed to such a fierce rival on a plate rover and honda the main links type of agreement example status equity honda has 20 stake in rover honda selling to bmw holdings cars rover has 20 stake in

describes as a black day for polling half of mori s projects now come from the public sector an indication of the importance attached by ministers to research mr worcester is currently working for the local government commission finding out what people on the ground want from the proposed re organisation of local government on one recent occasion the commission chose to ignore mori s findings and mr worcester says paid the price when its recommendations were criticised by the public mr worcester has survived as technology has advanced clients can now be given data an hour after a questionnaire has been received for evaluation but unlike the us where most research is conducted by telephone he prefers face to face interviews because at least in the uk they are cheaper and more comprehensive

vulnerable to potential disruption could be the so called project rover theta honda hh this is the new generation family car honda and rover are developing to replace the present rover 200 400 honda concerto the project is already advanced and production is due to begin in the autumn honda europe said yesterday that many of its suppliers were already tooling up and getting ready to supply components for the car its swindon plant has 201 suppliers in europe and many are also common suppliers to rover we would be very surprised if honda pulls out of this programme given the level of investment that has been made and how close they are to getting it into production said another leading uk components supplier yesterday if honda allows the theta hh programme to go ahead rover will produce its version under a licensing agreement the two companies will be forced to maintain close ties beyond the year 2000 the economics of the components supply programme and the economies of scale also suggest that honda cannot sensibly drop rover quickly last year rover production of its 200 400 version of the current generation car totalled 162 095 compared to production of only 18 406 for the much less successful concerto the new generation cars are likely to have a production ratio of at least 1 to 4 in favour of rover other factors also suggest that current honda rover projects in production and under development will continue the japanese carmaker is still relatively weak in europe its total new car sales across 17 markets in west europe amounted to only 162 000 last year giving it a west european market share of 1 4 per cent compared with the 3 5 per cent of nissan and the 2 8 per cent of toyota at home honda is experiencing serious overcapacity which could prove expensive to redress in the middle of recession where three successive years of declining sales are sapping the company s finances in the vital us market where the accord was once all conquering the car has been knocked from its perch as the best seller honda is having to invest heavily in a much more aggressive marketing campaign to try to halt the decline in europe rover always represented a low cost way into a market where honda was weaker than its japanese rivals it will now shut the door on the transfer of technology to rover which will have to look to the lessons it has already learned and to bmw to ensure that it stays on the path towards becoming a world class producer honda will drop rover in the long run but the uk carmaker may still be able to secure a soft landing

the shelling of sarajevo has been stopped nato has not actually launched any airstrikes but no one should doubt that its threat to do so was necessary perhaps the russian intervention was also necessary certainly it made it much easier for the serbs to comply more or less with nato s ultimatum without loss of face but without the ultimatum and the threat russia would almost certainly not have intervened in this way and even if it had done so the serbs would have been less likely to comply with russian requests as it is the ultimatum has had to be interpreted creatively to make it possible for general sir michael rose the un commander to certify compliance the effectiveness of un control over weapons remaining within the 20km radius exclusion zone is uncertain un member states have lamentably failed to provide general rose with the 3 000 extra troops he has requested thereby continuing the pattern of irresponsibility which has characterised all previous international action in the former yugoslavia france and britain the two leading contributors to the existing un force unprofor have smugly refused general rose s request suggesting it is for others to take a share of the burden however justified this implied criticism of the us it is hardly a constructive response nor is it calculated to strengthen atlantic solidarity in the next phase of the crisis both countries should recognise that their national prestige and interests are now irrevocably bound up with the un operation in bosnia if the operation fails for lack of manpower they may console themselves by blaming the us but it is they who will look most foolish strategic significance with luck the ceasefire in and around sarajevo will now hold at least for a time the serbs will probably move their weapons to other fronts of greater strategic significance such as brcko and bihac where bosnian government forces are still in a position to threaten communications between the serb held areas in croatia bosnia and serbia proper but a ceasefire does not in itself mean that the siege of sarajevo is lifted though that was nato s declared objective when it ordered the withdrawal of heavy weapons likewise the lifting of the siege of sarajevo would not relieve the suffering in other parts of bosnia including many that the un has officially taken under its protection in two of these srebrenica and tuzla specific actions ordered on pain of airstrikes by last month s nato summit have yet to take place and even the relief of all these places would not bring peace to bosnia as a whole exploit momentum so it is vital to exploit the momentum of the small success gained in sarajevo before it evaporates general rose was right to press ahead yesterday with plans to open roads into and out of the city and to repair water electricity and gas supplies he is right and should be given the fullest support by nato and the un security council in seeking to extend the sarajevo model to other parts of bosnia opening the airport at tuzla through which desperately needed food medicine and shelter could be brought to more than 1m civilians in central bosnia is an obvious priority but the plight of mostar which is worse than that of sarajevo must not be forgotten the serbs are not the only villains in this war it is croat forces with active support from the croatian regular army that have destroyed the historic bridge of mostar and are still raining down shells on the moslem population trapped on the east bank of the neretva president franjo tudjman of croatia a protege of germany and the vatican has still given no indication that he will withdraw his troops from western hercegovina an ultimatum to the croats around mostar would be amply justified would involve fewer political risks than that to the serbs around sarajevo and would make it easier to maintain russian support for a policy of firmness towards the serbs it is good too that us and russian officials are meeting with those of the eu and un in bonn today to push forward the diplomatic process only if the us russia and germany are very firm in urging concessions on their respective proteges in bosnia is there

head of sib can obtain the treasury s permission to recognise the new unitary watchdog and bring down the curtain on its two predecessors yesterday s publication of a prospectus inviting applications

financial services is to carry conviction the new body will have to reject applications from people who are currently authorised to conduct investment business that is not a recipe for popularity in the industry nor should it be meantime the recalcitrants who rank the prudential and standard life among their number have to ask what they can achieve by continuing to oppose the changes to the

hopelessly unrealistic in the light of repeated scandals to do with the industry s sales practices public confidence has been severely dented and will not be restored without some clear indication that the system is being significantly strengthened against that background the special pleading from leading practitioners about a surfeit of public interest representatives on the pia s board is a public relations disaster which undermines the credibility of the whole industry genuine alternative nor does it help to suggest that statutory regulation provides a genuine alternative to the problem in the long run it may or may not do but there is a crisis in the here and now and one which urgently needs to be addressed to suggest that consumers of financial services should be allowed to wait for several years while a statutory alternative is put in place looks at best disingenuous at worst it risks being interpreted as an attempt by the life assurers to make hay for as long as possible before the whistle is blown a unitary retail watchdog makes sense in a financial world where the organisational boundaries between banks insurers and other managers of personal savings have become

is using his formidable energy and influence to improve the secondary market liquidity in derivative linked or structured bonds an increasing number of borrowers are issuing structured bonds because the derivative element embedded in the bonds enables them to achieve a cheaper cost of funds than if they launched a straightforward eurobond or global bond offering structured bonds are equally popular with investors who want to back their views about the direction of anything from interest rates to an individual company s share price but since these transactions are frequently driven by fleeting arbitrage opportunities and tailored to specific investors they tend to be relatively small in relation to eurobond or global bond market offerings syndicate managers say the average size of structured bond offerings is about dollars 100m as a result investors often run into difficulty when they come to sell the bonds main complaints are the lack of price transparency and liquidity in the secondary market which means holders often receive less than the inherent value of the bonds world bank officials have discussed with about 200 investors how to reduce the deficiencies in the structured bond market they believe the innovative facilities of the world bank s imminent dollars 5bn global multi currency note programme should help to address these concerns the programme offers the following advantages price transparency the seven sponsoring dealers will regularly publish indicative bid prices for world bank structured bonds issued under the programme on dedicated screens distributed by widely available services the world bank expects that competitive pressures among dealers will lead them to improve secondary market prices secondary market liquidity by offering to exchange outstanding structured notes for new floating rate or structured notes the world bank hopes to be more supportive of sponsoring dealers secondary market activities than other issuers issuance trading and custody global documentation bonds issued under the programme may be governed by new york english or german law will allow for timely and streamlined issuance of structured bonds in a wide range of markets currencies and maturities the programme also provides for a choice of clearing systems and cross market clearing and settlement in major markets mr bim hundal head of medium term note mtn programmes at goldman sachs one of the sponsoring dealers of the world bank s programme says the world bank s decision to formalise the role of dealers is an important step in the development of the structured bond market the increased competition and the knowledge that the world bank is measuring their performance should encourage dealers to make realistic prices in the bonds the increased price transparency will benefit investors whenever they value their holdings either for regulatory or trading purposes the world bank hopes its measures will widen the investor appeal of structured bonds since it plans to raise at least dollars 2bn of its annual borrowing programme of between dollars 10bn and dollars 12bn through structured products these products will be linked only to interest rates and exchange rates although structured bonds tend to have relatively short maturities the result of investor worries about the lack of liquidity the world bank hopes its liquidity facility will enable it to achieve maturities of between four and 10 years the global platform built into the world bank s programme is likely to be imitated by other issuers who want to have one mtn programme which allows them access to all the world s major markets the volume of mtn programmes has grown rapidly over the past few years as issuers seek to lower their documentation costs and cut the time involved in launching a bond offering mr juan costain head of capital markets at kidder peabody another sponsoring dealer of the world bank s programme estimates that the volume of mtns grew by 2 1 2 times last year to dollars 127bn of this about dollars 60bn was in structured bonds and this year the volume could reach dollars 75bn according to mr costain the documentation costs for a euro mtn programme under which an issuer can make numerous eurobond offerings are about dollars 100 000 the same as for an individual eurobond offering although the documentation cost of a global programme is

on top of charges on share transactions and tax on dividends but if there is good news for chinese investors and foreign institutions warily testing the markets it lies in the apparent commitment of china s stock regulators to further economic liberalisation and to stiffening regulatory procedures professor li yining one of china s most influential economists and the head of a parliamentary committee drafting the new securities law believes that additional steps to bolster public trust in capital markets are vital for market reforms china s securities law is now in its seventh draft and prof li hopes that by the end of this year it will be implemented although a number of contentious issues remain to be resolved these include differences over the degree of self regulation to be allowed to local exchanges over whether over the counter trading will be permitted and whether state shares as opposed to those held by institutions and individuals should be traded in the market some officials fear this will lead to the state losing control of state enterprises prof li favours stronger central control over markets but says that given powerful provincial interests it would be difficult for a body like the us securities and exchange commission to emerge in china he also believes that otc trading should be permitted since to outlaw it would only encourage a black market and finally he feels that state owned shares should be traded otherwise they are dead most importantly however prof li sees the development of china s equity markets as a means of facilitating a faltering process of corporatisation and privatisation if we don t set up shareholding companies we will never be able to separate government and management he says among the authorities most urgent tasks is the effort to corporatise this is a chinese half way house to privatisation in which enterprises are detached from state control or fully privatise elements of the faltering state sector this involves dealing with the vexed property rights issue until the question of ownership of state assets is resolved and therefore who should be responsible for disposing of such assets the process of unravelling state control will prove difficult if not impossible various creative solutions have been advanced including channelling state assets into a special state investment corporation which would be responsible for divestiture the transfer of assets from the government itself to larger enterprises or the establishment of provincial commissions which would also be entrusted with the task of selling off state assets these solutions are believed to be reflected in one form or another in a draft law on controlling state assets submitted recently to the state council or cabinet this measure together with a new corporate law due to come into effect in july should go some way towards providing the legal basis for a rational process of divestiture prof li himself favours a combination of the various approaches mentioned above together with full privatisation for smaller enterprises and mixed state and private ownership for larger businesses along the lines of the french or scandinavian models foreign legal experts believe that china is slowly moving towards having a pretty good regulatory framework although they criticise what they regard as an arbitrary approach by the securities regulatory commission the national securities watchdog to selecting companies for overseas listing they note that of the latest batch of 23 companies selected for listing abroad six mainland companies listed in hong kong last year there is a preponderance of power companies including three from shandong province alone this suggests a less than rational approach in the selection

year issue ended last week with a yield of 6 62 per cent up from 6 40 a week earlier and some market analysts now think yields could rise to between 6 75 and 7 per cent before stabilising and reversing direction and that could feed through to a significant dip in equity indices the bond market has yet to be convinced that inflationary pressures are under control this was graphically

question is prompted by the surge in the currency relative to the dollar over the past week following the breakdown of us japanese trade talks and threats by washington to take fresh trade sanctions against tokyo the coming week will produce a great deal more huffing and puffing from the two capitals and this is likely to keep the relationship between the currencies volatile with the possibility of further yen appreciation from the rate of 104 60 to the dollar reached in late friday trading the yen s sharp rise stems from the market s expectation that washington will talk up the japanese currency to put negotiating pressure on the hosokawa government and the mere anticipation of such a move has obviated the need for overt action by the us which has sat back and tacitly accepted the yen s advance this week the clinton administration is expected to unveil tougher action to force the japanese to accept numerical import quotas and reduce their trade surplus in tokyo where the bank

a plan ready by next saturday when finance ministers from the g7 nations meet in frankfurt the market suspects the japanese may ask the g7 to intervene to support a rate of y110 to the dollar which officials in tokyo argue is more reflective of economic fundamentals certainly as ravi bulchandani of goldman sachs points out the real effective yen exchange rate is well above any level that the currency has been able to sustain in the past and prolonged continuation of the current rate will hurt the hosokawa administration undermining its economic stimulus package hitting corporate profitability and stock prices and possibly prolonging recession us policy makers face a trade off between a desire to squeeze genuine trade concessions out of japan and the knowledge that prolonging recession there is ultimately harmful to us exports and geo political interests tokyo for its part seems to have two central policy options one is to give considerable ground to the us on trade issues

willingness of newspapers to report the outpourings of model based forecasters gives economists a terribly bad name if manipulating giant and complex statistical models of the world economy delivered reliable results then all would be fine but the recent record of the uk treasury the international monetary fund or the organisation for economic co operation and development has been miserable anyone who doubts just how bad these models are at predicting cyclical turning points only need glance at the upper chart for a damning confirmation economics is just not suited to the kind of pseudo scientific futurology that these models purport to deliver engineering scientists can use theory and the results of controlled experiments to make accurate predictions about say the weight a bridge will bear before it falls but economists do not have the tools or the information that the engineer has to work with when they try for example to predict with any accuracy when the aggregate consumer savings ratio will fall economic theory provides a powerful conceptual framework but much of it is based on implausible assumptions about the rationality of human responses study of the statistical past can indicate plausible causal relationships but testing an economic inference about aggregate consumer behaviour using controlled experiments is almost always impossible not that economists can afford to stop trying to predict the future but if economists are useful to have around it is because of their deeply ingrained scepticism their willingness to doubt assumptions or ask whether the conclusions really follow the best uk city economists most of whom eschew large scale models are successful precisely because they continually doubt whether the future will be like the past their value lies in analysis although it their forecasts which make the headlines the problem with the oecd and other large scale forecasters aside from their ridiculous claims to accuracy is that their statistical models always require them to look back to the future finding patterns in the past to predict how tomorrow will be in this recession albeit a little late oecd economists produced some typically good analysis of the historically unprecedented debt burdens facing uk us or japanese companies and consumers but the implications for the pace of recovery were not incorporated into their forecasts at least not until the oecd s woefully erroneous forecasts had done terrible damage to its forecasting reputation yet the danger really starts when macro modellers graduate to policy making and try to elevate past statistical relationships to orthodox policy doctrine remember for example the uk treasury s repeated statements during the final months of sterling s membership of the european exchange rate mechanism in or out for the erm the uk could not cut interest rates below those in germany they said even a modest devaluation would inevitably lead to higher inflation they feared neither assertion seemed plausible at the time given the depressed state of the uk economy and both have been proved wrong since but the treasury has still not cottoned on worried about the resurgence of post devaluation inflation it has cut rates much more modestly than the us federal reserve has done with no apparent inflationary cost if growth remains sluggish the treasury will eventually sanction further cuts although history suggests they will come too late and stay low too long the failure of the imf to engage with russian reformers or provide funds for a successful stabilisation provides another example of the shortcomings of model based rule bound apolitical economics the imf has doggedly clung to the details of its standard programme tried and tested in latin america which makes any release of funds conditional on the prior closing of the budget deficit even though state spending cuts and the associated rise in unemployment were politically impossible in russia but as professor jeffrey sachs of harvard university has repeatedly pointed out there is nothing inherently inflationary about a budget deficit so long as it is financed by external finance rather than printing money the point of western aid should have been to stabilise the price level before the government started the painful task of cutting state subsidies to make aid a reward for success has merely made failure inevitable prof sachs criticism of the imf is a good example of economics at its best challenging conventional wisdom not with the black box of an econometric model but through a close study of all the available evidence economic analysis is most powerful when it pieces together a number of theoretical insights and statistical relations to build a convincing alternative view take the ross perot charge that import penetration from developing countries is undermining employment in us manufacturing industry is he right no say robert lawrence and paul krugman

explanation technological change favouring skilled workers is also driven by the threat of external competition whether the question is how to aid russia why consumer spending is so sluggish or the case for wage subsidies in east germany the same methodology works best macro modellers be they the oecd the imf or the treasury should put away their crystal balls and get back to economics this is

of companies quoted on the eight german stock exchanges is now a modest 664 collectively germany s quoted companies had a market capitalisation of about dm800bn dollars 466bn at the end of last year this represents 30 to 35 per cent of germany s gdp far less than in the uk the us japan or hong kong where the stock markets account for between 60 and more than 100 per cent of gdp these figures show that germany s stock market however popular with international investors last year the dax index of 30 leading shares rose 46 7 per cent in 1993 is underdeveloped the capitalisation of the german market is only the third largest in europe although germany is europe s largest economy the total number of new issues in germany over the last 10 years has been about 200 compared with 180 in the uk last year alone we looked on with envy at the number of new issues in the uk last year said mr werner seifert chief executive of the deutsche borse the german stock exchange this lack of development means that investors are denied the opportunity to buy into important sectors of the german economy such as food manufacturing or services because there are few quoted companies in these sectors there are at least 2 000 german manufacturing companies with turnover of dm100m or more that being the size at which the owners of such companies could bring them to the stock market in they wanted to the problem is as the meagre new issue statistics show few owners of such companies want to bring them to the market why should this be one consideration is that domestic institutional shareholders pension funds and insurance companies which are the natural buyers of new issue shares are thin on the ground in germany in 1990 when the bundesbank last published a study of the ownership structure of the german stock market such institutions owned just 12 per cent of the market compared with 55 per cent in the uk if institutional investors are under represented on the german stock market so are private households whose share of stock market ownership dropped from 27 per cent in 1960 to 17 per cent in 1990 in the case of new issues investors suspicions have been underscored by aggressive pricing a recent study from schroder munchmeyer hengst the german bank owned by lloyds bank of the uk shows that new issues have not proved to be very rewarding investments over 1992 93 only two of the 1992 new issues outperformed the market last year while two fell in price and one went bankrupt if these factors explain why there is limited demand for shares in new companies they do not address

expressed time and time again by family owners of companies which in the us or the uk would almost without exception be listed the reason is that the move from private company to quote company status forces a reorientation of priorities it is a big step from managing the business with a view to paying as small a tax bill as possible to generating profits for outside shareholders says an official at commerzbank owners do not want the publicity associated with a quote he says they are not particularly interested in money either they are rich enough already they are more concerned not to lose

kajo neukirchen the troubleshooter appointed as chief executive in december last year will hold his first press conference since he took over from the sacked mr heinz schimmelbusch having kept his silence until now but for a few sentences uttered for the benefit of the television cameras and a handful of short press releases he will outline his plans for the group which has 58 000 employees working at 258 subsidiaries he has already said there will be massive redundancies and that numerous subsidiaries will be sold details will emerge tomorrow on thursday mr ronaldo schmitz the deutsche bank director who is also chairman of metallgesellschaft s supervisory board will preside over an extraordinary shareholders meeting there are formal legal reasons for the meeting following the departure of mr schimmelbusch and other boardroom colleagues but the supervisory board is expected to seize the opportunity to defend its own conduct throughout the affair while tomorrow s press conference is expected to focus on metallgesellschaft s future the annual meeting on thursday will concentrate on the past mr schmitz is likely to face a grilling from aggrieved shareholders anxious to know how it was that the supervisory board consisting of some of the most distinguished names in german business could have failed to prevent the near catastrophe the crisis was triggered by mg corp metallgesellschaft s us trading subsidiary whose activities in the oil futures markets are expected to give rise to a dm1 5bn loss in the current financial year critics will argue at the meeting that beyond the immediate causes of metallgesellschaft s problems there is evidence of a system failure reflecting the close relations between big german banks and the company if they didn t know what was going on they failed in their duty to supervise said the chief economist of a foreign bank in frankfurt if they did know there was a cover up and that is equally bad the problem is that the members of german supervisory boards are self selecting they are members of a club the economist continued shareholders are formally supposed to control the supervisory boards via the way they vote at annual meetings but this does not work because the banks own big stakes themselves and can vote large stakes on behalf of other shareholders who lodge their shares for custody at the banks criticism has tended to be dismissed until now but the metallgesellschaft case shows that there is a weakness which threatens the fabric of the german economy he concluded mr schmitz has been praised by fellow board members for the energetic way he has led the supervisory board at metallgesellschaft since he took over as chairman last april he is likely to argue on thursday that he was entitled be kept informed by the management board but that he was not kept in the picture\n"}, {"id": "FT941-8214", "title": "ft 21 feb 94 international company news sega sees downturn in profit for year", "body":

revealed the future of rover as talks between bmw and honda start today", "body": "in the three weeks since rover was sold to bmw the german car maker and honda motor rover s partner for 15 years have been eyeing each other closely to see which will blink first the poker game begins in earnest today in tokyo as mr bernd pischetsrieder bmw s chairman begins talks with mr nibuhiko kawamoto honda s president both parties have powerful cards to play honda s wounded pride and loss of face caused by british aerospace s sale of its 80 per cent stake in rover might suggest a complete severing of honda s links with rover honda in fact has the power in its rover agreements to shut down much of rover it can give seven days notice to cancel its key contracts if rover was sold to another party that however would fly in the face of commercial common sense at least in the medium term it has too much to lose from selling parts to rover and anyway the relationship cannot physically be unpicked overnight but bmw s wish that in this new scenario rover cars will naturally continue its agreements with honda in every respect is just as unlikely to come to pass bmw wants rover for example to give it a market presence in the lower medium front wheel drive sector rover plans to launch next year a replacement to its 200 400 series jointly developing the model with honda in project theta yet the partners are understood to have failed yet to sign a full production agreement and honda could baulk honda sees the german car maker as one of its most potent rivals in the world car market and it is impossible to expect that honda s doors can now remain as open to rover assuming honda does not plump for the doomsday scenario there there are three levels of collaboration between honda and rover which the japanese car maker and bmw must now address licensing agreements on original honda products the selling and buying of components production and technology transfer from honda to rover these links are cemented by honda s 20 per cent equity stake in the whole of the rover vehicle operations including land rover and rover s 20 per cent stake in honda s uk assembly plant at swindon licensing most of rover s cars are based on or dependent on honda designs and are produced under direct licence from honda these agreements can be terminated at three months notice whole vehicles subject to them are the rover 600 and 400 models but rover has greater leeway on the 200 hatchback because the 200 was a jointly developed vehicle rover enjoys component supply contracts for as long as it builds the current model this anomaly arose because the honda concerto model on which the rover 200 400 range is based appeared in japan first as a saloon and the 400 was licensed directly from it whereas the 200 was developed jointly typical of critical component issues is the gearbox used on rover s own two litre engines this is a honda product made under licence by rover at its longbridge plant in birmingham withdrawal of its licence could disrupt much of the rest of rover s car range apart from the ageing montego maestro metro and mini models the 800 executive car range would be affected even though the car itself has long since diverged from the honda legend on which it was based however honda must supply other key components in it notably the 2 7 litre honda v6 engine for as long as rover wants to build the car buying and selling components this is a normal arm s length customer supplier relationship for most components involving two way transactions of close to pounds 400m a year for example honda sells facias to rover for the rover 600 and rover sells honda the body panels produced at rover s swindon stamping plant for the honda accord which honda produces at its own assembly plant in swindon the contracts state supplies must continue for as long as each partner is producing a particular model however these contracts are subservient to the licensing agreements honda considers that it could legitimately pull the plug on much of rover s model range even though rover could still be legally required to continue providing body panels for the accord but pulling the plug would severely disrupt production at honda s own plant in swindon manufacturing and technology transfer much of the equipment and tooling used by rover to build the 600 and 200 400 were developed and supplied by honda the equipment was replicated and transferred into rover s longbridge plant thus saving rover heavy expenditures on developing production facilities for new models a highly sophisticated multi welder for body shells for example is from honda engineering if honda terminated the relevant agreements however rover could maintain the equipment adequately for the life of current models another key element of the relationship is the maintenance of the component supplier base honda manages its supplier base of 160 companies on behalf of itself and rover and rover does the same with its suppliers feeding rover s plants and honda s at swindon the overall appearance of cars might not change but their parts are updated constantly as part of the japanese inspired philosophy of continuous improvement lack of access by either partner to the database which keeps track of 20 000 parts could bring chaos to production lines as component mismatches proliferated one measure of the trust honda and rover had developed is that the database for the accord rover 600 is managed and maintained only by honda at swindon working relationships honda believes bmw may not have understood how dependent rover is on honda and how close working relations had become honda rover is not only a business based corporate relationship according to one senior honda executive in europe so many engineers so many managers and so many production people have worked closely together for 15 years this working together is a quite unique experience for the japanese people as well as the british and i believe that it could create very good mutual understanding between our two cultures for most of the people involved in this collaboration it has been not only their job but their life including their families some 150 rover personnel went to japan to learn production start up techniques for the rover 200 400 and some 40 japanese honda staff and their families went to birmingham to stay for nearly three years in getting the project off the ground when honda asked rover to build its concerto model at longbridge honda opened its factories to rover staff to allow them to feed back quality information the information exchange has accelerated ever since so there is not only information exchange in the conference room there was hand to hand working together on the shop floor the honda executive said for its part bmw can offer honda the lucrative opportunity of continuing to work with rover and for example to supply land rover discovery four wheel drive vehicles with honda badges for the japanese market but honda is sure of its bargaining power as one senior honda executive put it informally we hold a card hand of nine aces but the british public does not

the uk to optus in australia the challenger to the former antipodean state telecoms monopoly we are not just a holding company for a diverse range of telecoms activities we make sense as a federation and intend to strengthen the bonds between the different parts said mr ross c w he argues is currently undervalued because it does not attract the premium it deserves as a sum of more than its parts the essential bond the company has now discovered is a coherent investment strategy giving pride of place to growth in the asia pacific region this is the home of hong hong telecom c w s richest pearl which accounted last year for pounds 554m of its pounds 829m operating profit mr ross spells out what this priority means a commitment over the medium term to devote hong kong telecom s free cash flow to investments in the asia pacific outside hong kong we have underinvested in the area and we are now intent on growing other asian opportunities mr ross highlighted opportunities to build and operate networks in under developed asian markets china is the great object but with telecoms racing ahead in all parts of the region not the sole magnet other companies for which read bt and at t in their ambitions to be global providers to the multinationals don t really go in for those construction projects we are playing a different competitive game which is not the big multinationals he is also explicit about c w s european strategy which is two pronged in the larger markets like germany and france c w will be the mercury in europe building networks to challenge the monopolies of state operators as liberalisation advances in the smaller markets such as ireland and portugal it is looking for opportunities to partner existing monopoly operators we don t believe there is enough room for a national competitor and the existing operators need an international player like us what will unite the federation people products and a global network capacity said mr ross he pointed to the swapping of senior managers like the recent exchange between the deputy chief executives of mercury and hong kong telecom and he emphasised the convergence in terms of services and marketing of world telecoms markets take hong kong we have got competition there next year and intend to make full use of our experience as the under dog in britain in facing it mr ross s strategy faces an immediate objection as a company less than a third the size of bt how is c w going to fund serious expansion from three hubs worldwide the third being the caribbean region more over to make itself attractive to the chinese c w arguably needs an image more regional than global mr ross implicitly accepted both points by playing down the investment outlays to be expected outside asia pacific and stressing the trend towards indigenous management as reflected in the recent appointment of mr linus cheung deputy managing director of cathay pacific airways as chief executive of hong kong telecom partnership is the key said mr ross we can t even try to operate on our own in many places but we have experience and networks that can bring a lot to any partnership whether in china or germany as for resources he cited c w s low gearing about 13 per cent suggesting an increase in spending from the current pounds 1bn a year to pounds 1 5bn to be a responsible objective the strategy has clear attractions partnership between indigenous and overseas operators is the industry trend from cellular mobile services in europe and the us to basic line building ventures in asia for governments and indigenous telecoms operators c w has a top notch name without being one of the large perhaps more threatening us or european forces the capacity to learn in one market to profit in another will give a critical edge as competition advances to benefit it may not be size so much as presence that matters and c w s presence is more widely spread than most but if hong telecom s free cash flow is to go into asia a question mark must be raised over the european strand to c w s thread particularly if mercury s profits are depressed by the explosion of competition in the uk as mr ross puts it we don t have a home

the first route to be put out to tender the gatwick express between london and gatwick airport is already running as a shadow franchise under the existing management later this year the franchise for running the line will be put out to tender several more shadow franchises will be established in april in preparation for tendering early next year on most routes the managers will be encouraged to lead management buyouts at the same time as passenger services are privatised other parts of british rail will be prepared for sale these include freight operations and the three leasing companies that will lease rolling stock to the operating companies br s maintenance operations are to be privatised as more than a dozen competing companies and railtrack the organisation created to run the rail infrastructure will take over responsibility for the network from april the success of rail privatisation however will be judged by the benefits it brings for passengers ensuring that the customer sees real improvements in services requires the emergence of competitive and entrepreneurial rail operators businesses thinking about entering this new market or providing finance for it will need to be convinced that there are profitable opportunities charges there must be grounds for concern therefore over the charges that operators will have to pay for using the railway network the charges will rightly reflect the operating costs of railtrack on the routes covered by each franchise these include track maintenance signalling costs depot charges and the cost of electricity amazingly some of these were not allocated to particular lines under br s internal accounting system but the charges also reflect a treasury target that railtrack should make a 5 6 per cent return on its assets valued at around pounds 6 5bn the rate of return will rise to 8 per cent within four years tight target this target is excessively tight an 8 per cent rate of return is unnecessarily steep for what is essentially a utility as for the value put on the assets it can plausibly be argued that it should be much higher than pounds 6 5bn since br still owns a lot of land in inner city sites alternatively it might be set much lower given the age of much of the track signalling and stations and their run down state what is clear is that applying such a high rate of return to this asset value will add around pounds 500m to the charges that rail operators must pay bumping up charges in this way could lead to the rail network being used inefficiently at much less than capacity it will also mean that fewer of the franchises will be profitable without public subsidy this creates a merry go round in which the revenue extracted by the treasury from railtrack must be paid out in subsidies to rail operators to pay higher than necessary track charges the aim of these arrangements is to concentrate public subsidy for passenger services on one part of the system the rail operators the operator can of course still make a profit while receiving a subsidy by maximising revenues and efficiency however businesses thinking about entering this new market may find the prospect of relying on treasury subsidies for the duration of a franchise less than appetising this will be especially the case if the government agrees to franchise periods as long as 15 years to encourage operators to invest in new rolling stock the arrangements for setting railtrack s charges are likely to reduce the attractiveness of investment opportunities in rail operations given the need to attract businesses into this new sector this cannot be an outcome that is welcome to supporters of privatisation\n"}, {"id": "FT941-8254", "title": "ft 21 feb 94 leading article end game on

telecommunications gas electricity airport and port projects that would knit europe s far flung regions with the core of the european union and provide an infrastructure backbone for the single market the networks would also extend beyond the union into european free trade association countries and eastern europe the programme s total cost is put at ecu400bn pounds 300bn by the end of the century of this ecu220bn would be for transport projects ecu150bn for telecommunications and ecu30bn for energy leaders at last december s brussels summit gave the initiative a qualified go ahead they approved the overall thrust but not specific details in particular commission plans for financing the programme now the commission s challenge is to refine its plans and win over the doubters a crucial role will be played by mr henning christophersen the economics commissioner who will today chair the second meeting of a taskforce consisting of high level officials from each member state the group will hear new commission ideas on how the initiative could be financed it will also discuss which transport and energy projects should receive priority a parallel taskforce consisting of telecommunications users operators and manufacturers is being chaired by mr martin bangemann the industry commissioner it will look at how an advanced telecommunications infrastructure which would be needed if say teleworking from home was to become much more common can be developed the commission is anxious that europe does not fall behind the us where the clinton administration is trying to encourage the construction of such information superhighways meanwhile officials from more than half a dozen commission directorates are working on detailed aspects of the trans european networks initiative both the christophersen and bangemann groups will present progress reports to the next european summit in corfu in june the reason the initiative was launched was belief in brussels that european businesses and consumers are disadvantaged because networks have developed on national rather than transnational lines networks were designed to satisfy the european nation states of the 19th century says mr christophersen there are many examples of what commission officials see as anomalies cross border phone calls cost three times as much as domestic calls of a similar distance air travellers can face long delays because poorly co ordinated national air traffic control systems cannot handle as many flights as a single unified system italian lorries thunder through the rhine valley on their way to rotterdam because italy s ports are not modern enough and there are as yet no high speed rail links between national capitals enthusiasm in brussels is one thing winning the necessary support and finance from member states is quite another the general idea that fragmented networks damage europe s competitiveness has widespread acceptance that was why an article was written into the maastricht treaty giving the commission authority to draw up proposals for trans european networks and promote their development but there is still much debate about three big questions are all the projects identified by the commission really necessary will the union need to subsidise the networks or can investment be left to member states and private companies will the networks develop faster and more efficiently if traditional national monopolies in telecommunications energy and transport are abolished doubts over the list of projects stem largely from the way they have been chosen the commission asked member states to propose candidates and then collated the suggestions into master plans but because favoured projects may qualify for eu subsidies each government had an incentive to get as many of its national projects as possible included the initiative is viewed in some quarters as the next european gravy train it is about money admits a transport official in one member state this explains why the programme s cost has reached a staggering ecu400bn it also explains why the list includes projects which appear to be of mainly national rather than pan european benefit for example the master plan for trans european roads consisting of 55 000km of roads 12 000km of them motorways is largely an amalgamation of existing national road plans officials argue that even when infrastructure is confined to a single member state it may be of broader european interest for two reasons spill over effects for example ireland has an interest in motorways being built across england and wales so its traffic can have easy access to the channel tunnel equally a planned railway from rotterdam to the border with germany will be more profitable if germany continues the line into its industrial ruhr region incompatible standards for example trains travelling from sweden to denmark have to switch to a different electricity system similarly many advanced telecommunications services such as electronic mail systems do not interconnect smoothly across borders the commission believes it can play a useful role in co ordinating investment plans across frontiers one way of achieving this could be for the commission to hold roundtable discussions for particular projects to identify what is stopping them moving ahead the commission would then knock heads together to remove the blockages a prime candidate would be air traffic control says mr robert coleman head of the commission s transport directorate national air traffic controllers have been discussing harmonising their systems for years without much progress the new powers in the maastricht treaty would allow aviation ministers to vote on a common approach and then make it stick mr christophersen admits that not every project in the overall programme is equally important but he says the commission has already made a preliminary selection of priority projects which cost only ecu160bn his taskforce will further refine priorities examples of the priority projects include high speed rail links between london paris brussels cologne and amsterdam at a total cost of ecu8 5bn a motorway from berlin to moscow via warsaw costing ecu3 2bn and a new athens airport costing ecu2bn even if agreement is reached on priorities the financing of the new networks will remain controversial in his white paper mr delors argued that the union would need to provide ecu20bn a year in subsidies and loans of this ecu5bn would come from the union s cohesion and structural funds these channel aid to europe s poorest regions and countries in particular spain portugal greece and ireland this money has already been earmarked in the union s budget a further ecu7bn mr delors suggested could be raised by loans from the european investment bank the final ecu8bn would be raised on the financial markets by the commission and then lent to governments or private companies this last proposal for what were dubbed union bonds caused particular controversy at the brussels summit germany and the uk criticised it on the grounds that borrowing by the commission would offer governments a back door route to avoiding public expenditure disciplines the critics were also concerned that the commission s aaa credit rating in financial markets might be damaged if it made large loans to countries with poorer credit ratings such as greece and italy they said that if more money for infrastructure investment was needed it should come from the eib which has a track record in project finance these objections have caused the commission to beat a tactical retreat mr christophersen says union bonds are just one of several financial instruments that could boost infrastructure investment mr enrico cioffi head of the commission s investment directorate suggests other possibilities bonds issued by the commission but linked to particular road rail air or maritime traffic projects coupons paid to investors might depend on the volume of traffic the project attracts loan guarantees by the commission these could be used for those parts of a network located outside the union such as motorways or telecommunications lines extending into eastern europe although the commission is no longer pushing union bonds as the main option the thinking behind the other ideas remains the same the commission could use its aaa status to cut borrowing costs for countries with lower credit ratings the benefit for states such as greece italy ireland and denmark could be the equivalent of between half and one percentage point off interest rates says mr cioffi but such proposals could run into the same opposition from member states as union bonds part of the ecu20bn envisaged by mr delors could be provided as direct subsidies to projects though the commission has yet to spell out how this might work subsidies would not necessarily be limited to regions that already qualify for structural and cohesion funds some member states however are worried that such handouts could be a waste of public money they could merely lead to the construction of grandiose projects with little economic benefit whatever is decided on union funding there is a consensus that national budgets are so strapped that the bulk of the money for trans european networks will have to come from the private sector this raises the question of whether a bigger push is needed to privatise and liberalise monopoly sectors there are sharp differences between member states over liberalisation the uk has traditionally led the free market group while france has supported the continuation of public sector monopolies within the commission there are similar though less sharp differences most officials agree that liberalisation would help the trans european network initiative but they differ over whether the commission needs to do more than it is already doing the liberal camp believes that national monopolies in transport telecommunications and energy are the root cause of fragmented networks public sector monopolies have little incentive to look beyond their national frontiers while their monopoly status has prevented private operators building transnational links instead those who hold this view point to the us where transcontinental networks and competitive markets go hand in hand in particular they say a lesson is to be learnt from the clinton administration which is seeking to develop us information superhighways by liberalising the telecommunications and cable television industries rather than pumping in government money abolishing monopolies would allow private investment to flow into infrastructure projects priorities would be chosen on economic criteria as companies sought out the most profitable opportunities there would also be less need to co ordinate investment as operators would be free to range across boundaries the big issue is lifting the restrictions that is the only way of mobilising the investment says mr herbert ungerer who runs the commission s telecommunications policy unit but others say that liberalisation is not the complete story for a start it is harder to apply the approach in loss making sectors such as railways and roads than in profitable sectors such as telecommunications and energy moreover even in a liberalised market there would be a need for co ordinated investment and harmonised standards such issues will have to be addressed by eu member states in the next few months if the foundations of trans european networks are to be laid before the end of the century with the future of european competitiveness at stake there is already some impetus behind the plans but if the trans european network initiative is really to gather momentum members will have to overcome any qualms they may have about a fresh commitment to working together on a pan continental scale\n"}, {"id": "FT941-8256",

in its third year of a robust economic recovery business investment and productivity are soaring the us share of foreign markets is up sharply the budget and trade deficits are much reduced unemployment has fallen sharply to well below 7 per cent europe and japan by contrast are floundering in recession in the circumstances you might expect the white house to feel relaxed even magnanimous instead mr clinton and his senior advisers are behaving like economic delinquents in december mr clinton hailed the merits of the uruguay round which promises to deregulate agriculture and financial services sectors in which the us is highly competitive as a new democrat he was all for multilateral trade liberalisation under the gatt yet a mere two months later he solemnly chastises mr morihiro hosokawa japan s reform minded prime minister for refusing to accept numerical targets for import growth in selected industrial sectors such targets essentially a government commitment to reserve a portion of japan s home market for us and foreign companies are the very antithesis of the gatt principles that mr clinton was promoting so hard last year perhaps mr clinton is genuinely incapable of understanding the contradiction if so it is lamentable that economically literate senior aides including larry summers at the treasury are so eager to play this charade us officials of course sometimes claim they are not demanding numerical targets all they want are quantitative benchmarks to judge progress in opening japanese markets this is spurious talk of medal winning dimensions it is not as though japanese trade figures are a state secret quantitative measures of progress in opening specific markets have always been readily available in any case as a member of a multilateral system the us simply has no right to act as judge and jury on japanese trade practices to put us behaviour in perspective suppose france analysed us wine consumption and found an unfair bias in favour of inferior californian brands would mr clinton be happy if president mitterrand unilaterally set a numerical target for increased us imports of french burgundy of course not he would instantly condemn such bully boy tactics the obsession with the japanese bilateral imbalance is even more fatuous white house talk of impenetrable barriers creates the false impression that japan buys virtually nothing from the us in reality us exports to japan were dollars 48bn last year making it america s second most important market the bilateral deficit with japan is declining relative to us national income but even if it were rising it would signify nothing surely mr clinton s high powered economic advisers have not forgotten the very first lesson of economics that trade is beneficial because it facilitates specialisation and division of labour the last thing we should expect or want is balanced trade between every pair of countries the almost gloating way in which mr clinton with mr christopher dutifully in attendance announced his trade deal with king fahd is particularly disturbing nobody can deny that political leaders in other countries have sought economic favours but in past years transgressions by smaller countries were comparatively unimportant because us commitment to market principles guaranteed the survival of a liberal global trading order when the boundaries between government and business begin to blur in the world s biggest economy the outlook is indeed grim european and japanese leaders are certain to respond by redoubling their efforts on behalf of their national champions for 200 years two quite distinct capitalist philosophies have vied for supremacy the first is the english concept not always respected by british governments of genuinely liberal competition in which governments keep off the pitch and companies compete solely on the basis on commercial merit the second is the corporatist state first perfected by 19th century prussia in which government acts as sponsor of domestic business in an economic war against other nations sadly mr clinton seems to be leaning in the prussian direction no true market liberal would brag about winning contracts for businessmen or set unilateral targets for another nation s imports or pour taxpayers funds into a domestic industrial policy yet mr clinton is doing all of this and with relish

his consideration of positive aspects of ireland s economy focuses on the age structure of the population as the constraint on raising living standards but ireland has a productivity competitiveness

young people in the irish population in 1992 just over half of the irish population of working age were in employment but in the uk the proportion was almost 70 per cent there has been a long run failure to generate a sufficiently large industrial base and this failure is a reflection of a lack of competitiveness in the aggregate statistics the unfavourable performance of domestically owned firms is masked by the very rapid growth of the foreign owned manufacturing sector detailed study of irish indigenous enterprises in sectors such as farming transport energy tourism and business services indicates that productivity levels are substantially lower than those in the uk irish products are frequently uncompetitive with respect to price or non price characteristics the increase in gross domestic product has indeed been rapid during 1988 1993 but it is usually accepted that gnp provides a better indicator of the irish population s material well being because it makes allowance

easy to define or describe many companies they will be a web of alliances joint projects arrangements and pacts more risks will be shared companies will have centres but rather than head offices they will be small centres designed on the principle of reverse delegation with the centre only doing what the parts on their own cannot do and which they therefore delegate to the centre companies will be federations of bits and pieces joined together in different ways for different purposes as a result it will be increasingly difficult for shareholders to know what they are buying into or to what sort of risks they are exposed it will be all the more difficult because the real assets of the business the intellectual assets will still be largely unquantifiable unless accountancy groups come up with new measures in the best businesses today the market value of the business is three or four times the tangible assets and in a good manufacturing company labour costs should not be more than 10 per cent of the product price that leaves lots of unmeasured space shareholders will be more careful about long term money and more likely to want some money today rather than possibly more money later contrary therefore to most prescriptions for better corporate governance we may see companies edging further away from shareholders in an attempt to give more emphasis to the long term future of the business directors may see themselves as mainly accountable to their own people who have a real incentive to build a better future to put it another way when human capital becomes more important than financial capital it will be the human capital which calls the tunes this may be a gradual change but it will be profound in the end the driving motive for most senior managers is to build a sustainable enterprise to achieve this and to recognise their new accountability to human capital companies will look for ways to turn key people into quasi partners some will hope to do that by more consultation but ultimately partnership means money not talk that is likely to entail not share option schemes which are a form of risk free betting but genuine share ownership perhaps with double voting rights as in some continental companies and with substantial shares in each year s added value this will not be primarily an incentive for employees rather will it be an expression of their membership rights some companies may decide to venture further down this membership route limiting voting rights to large investors owning more than 1 per cent perhaps or to their own people it will always be a cautious experiment however for fear of alienating the wider market which will not want to see its rights eroded too far the formal aim of the company would still be as it has always been to add value but value would no longer be determined solely by the price of the shares but by other measures of the long term health of the business measures which would be more relevant to the membership than to temporary smaller investors to continue to add ever more value companies will have to be inclusive building long term relationships with customers suppliers and the community but all the main constituents would then pull in one direction the sustainable future of the business tomorrow s companies will do all this because they will need to not because of some ideological

films like jubilee and the tempest in late films like the garden edward ii and wittgenstein he rejected star casting and multiple locations to film with largely unknown actors in tiny studios abandoned warehouses or derelict country homes borrowed or rented and dressed up in the colours of his imagination the location for jarman s films was his own mind he came to directing from painting and designing opera ballet ken russell s the devils and he took the self expressive spirit of the 1960s the time of his studentship at the slade school of art into virtually all his later films these began as experimental shorts shot on super 8 and or video to achieve jarman s unique early style a dream like blurry staccato like paintings shimmering into life later some of the improvisatory style

1980 campaign and then moved on to patton boggs and blow where his clients ranged from japanese corporations to haiti s duvalier family and where he began to make serious money and some enemies the new york times came close to opposing his nomination a year ago mostly because he had been that ultimate object of mistrust a lobbyist in 1988 he managed the rev jesse jackson s bid for the presidency and he was still seen mostly as a tool of the kennedy jackson liberal axis when against many odds he was elected democratic party national chairman early in 1989 this induced undisguised delight among republicans george will the conservative columnist wrote at the time democrats are already turning briskly to the business of losing the 1992 election and some of them believe that the coming election

divide into two camps the anti smoking anglo saxon countries and their former colonies and the pro smoking rest of the world on the issue of smoking in aircraft france would appear to be an honorary anglo saxon country in the anti corner us carriers forbid smoking on all domestic flights british airways has not allowed smoking on its domestic flights since 1988 sas bans smoking on flights within scandinavia and singapore airlines has smoke free short haul routes on its silk air subsidiary these rules are not as strict for long haul international flights perhaps because airlines recognise that it is harder for tobacco addicts to go without for eight or 10 hours many airlines have no smoking flights only on routes where there are at least two daily flights smoking is banned on one and allowed on the other such flights are available from ba cathay pacific and singapore airlines between europe and asia and on many us carriers across the atlantic or pacific for short haul international flights carriers are more divided while sas still allows smoking on flights outside scandinavia air france last month banned smoking on flights of less than two hours ba plans to prohibit smoking on flights of less than 90 minutes from this summer more than 400 flights a week will be affected between the uk and much of northern europe such changes of policy at ba and air

right to smoke overcame those arguing that the health and comfort of others were more important says the carrier many asian and south european carriers have not even experimented with no smoking policies perhaps because smoking is more popular in those regions is it possible for an airline to please both supporters and opponents of smoking air france is trying it has a special smoking compartment on flights to japan and south korea economy class smokers sit at the back of the aircraft separated from other passengers by thick curtains while non smokers may applaud efforts like this they might be less pleased by the issue of the freshness of the air itself only us carriers have statistics about cabin air freshness at their fingertips most other carriers contacted by the ft had to consult their engineering departments and often did not know precise figures the results of the survey show that when it comes to air freshness the type of aircraft matters at least as much as who owns it it is not easy to change cabin air frequently at 40 000ft the external air can be minus 60 c and almost completely dry it must be heated by 80 c and have moisture added before it is pumped into the cabin this all uses fuel so the latest boeing and airbus aircraft introduced since the mid 1980s try to cut down on the waste by recycling some warm and relatively moist cabin air airlines insist that this does no harm to passengers the air is filtered using a mesh that catches many bacteria sleeping people extract very little oxygen so the air the second time round should be just as capable of sustaining life as it was the first time nevertheless those who want completely fresh air circulating around them should avoid travelling in new aircraft such as the boeing 747 400 and airbus a320 while smaller aircraft tend to change the air more frequently travellers paying for the most expensive seats will get better air quality than those with cheap tickets the air in an aircraft flows from the front to the back the further forward you are the fresher the air unless there are smokers in front moreover with fewer passengers per square metre in the more expensive seats

finding insurance cover for employees who suffer accidents or become ill through their work employers liability insurance which is compulsory for uk companies has already become much more expensive in the past three years next year the situation could get worse if as expected insurers reduce the scope of cover offered in typical policies because of moves by their own reinsurance companies to restrict protection according to the uk risk managers association airmic the issue ranks alongside the environment and terrorism as among the most pressing facing insurance buyers it is a problem area says alan fleming executive director of airmic he estimates that employers liability insurance can amount to 40 per cent of overall insurance costs for some companies premium rates for manual workers have risen by an average of at least 20 to 30 per cent annually in recent years with rates rising in some cases from perhaps 0 2 per cent to between 5 per cent and 8 per cent of payroll the more serious threat is that employers face even steeper increases for their white collar workers rates are rising from 0 01 per cent to as much as 0 3 per cent of payroll the background to all this is a rise in claims costs which reflects a number of political and social trends new official health and safety requirements and the greater willingness of workers especially when organised in trade unions to claim damages in the courts have led to a surge in disease claims these now account for between 25 per cent and 40 per cent of the pounds 500m paid each year in employers liability claims by uk insurance companies compared to less than 20 per cent 10 years ago the picture is expected to deteriorate further as claims from victims of new conditions such as repetitive strain injury rsi and stress come to the courts a recent award of pounds 79 000 in an rsi case involving a former inland revenue typist is likely to encourage trade unions which are backing action by other injured workers and has highlighted what james hopper employers liability specialist with sedgwick the insurance broker recently qualified as a potential epidemic the biggest headache of all could be finding an insurer in the first place a number of companies have withdrawn from the market and no longer offer standalone policies and more are likely to follow suit reinsurers have become concerned about the scale of potential losses following claims stemming from the piper alpha oil rig explosion in 1988 they have consequently begun to curb the traditionally unlimited cover they offer insurance companies insurers now expect reinsurers to limit cover to between pounds 5m and pounds 10m per occurrence when they renew their annual policies for 1995 this means insurers may have to introduce changes into their own contracts as they come up for renewal later this year what can companies do derek howie assistant liability manager for eagle star the bat industries subsidiary predicts the emergence of a new excess of loss market where corporate buyers will be able to obtain cover above the limits made available from their traditional insurers but risk managers brokers and insurers expect the new combination of circumstances to lead to greater interest in self insurance with many buyers increasing the amount of risk they leave uninsured or self insured already many larger uk companies cover all claims under a certain level with a limit of pounds 100 000 typical for some large companies basically it can allow cost savings companies are managing predictable claims of a modest size themselves rather than handing over responsibility to insurance companies says john stoker a consultant who works with tillinghast the actuaries and management consultants self insurance can help cut legal bills which add thousands of pounds to costs the self insurance option is frequently accompanied by a more pro active approach to claims management companies can also reduce their employers liability costs by recognising when people have a real claim and doing everything they can to settle it quickly explains stoker trying to resist all claims is like pushing water uphill he comments another option is to create a captive company a specially created subsidiary dedicated to insuring the risks of the parent and its subsidiaries forming a captive insurance company can be expensive partly because captive managers must arrange for policies to be fronted by an insurance company licensed by the department of trade and industry according to hopper this guarantee can cost between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the premium paid claims handling charges also add to the expense howie at eagle star points out that insurers can provide valuable experience in advising employers on the complex legal issues surrounding some claims even so self insurance can still be an attractive option for many buyers especially larger companies in the short term there is not a lot of money going out explains hopper above all the shrinkage in insurance cover will encourage companies to find ways of controlling risk through improvements in management and safety procedures liz taylor risk manager of harrisons and crosfield the conglomerate and a former airmic president recommends adoption of the best possible standards of health and safety the point is that if employers are unable to buy financial protection for loss at an acceptable price they may be forced to step up actions to prevent losses in the first place\n"}, {"id": "FT941-8281", "title": "ft 21 feb 94 management fast

telephone calls by 1998 at the same time the cash hungry belgian finance ministry has started to size up the company for privatisation and telecoms competitors have begun forging international alliances but on january 5 this year kok announced that belgacom had achieved the goals of its ambitious 1992 93 strategy it had reduced the time taken to connect most new customers to 20 days and set a target of five days by the end of this year launched a new image and established a modern digital mobile telephone network with pacific telesis international a subsidiary of pactel the us

where he was chief executive for seven years a dedicated chess fan and professor of strategic management at brussels flemish university he arrived with private sector preconceptions about belgacom s inefficient bureaucracy however he was absolutely astonished by the attitude of most of the company s 26 000 staff the company had a very strong willingness to change says kok it went very deep in the organisation and if you really analyse it that s logical it isn t funny to be perceived by the majority of the public as a sleepy organisation that doesn t listen kok s management style is direct he began belgacom s metamorphosis with a letter to staff telling them tomorrow will not be like yesterday and that the old monopoly certainties were being undermined by technological advances and pan european liberalisation as an organisation we believe that this is irreversible kok said as far as our company is concerned we do not believe that there will be a return to what we call the old times since kok s arrival the group s 4m subscribers have become clients whose needs are paramount a marketing department was set up with 100 staff and a referendum issued to customers to find out what they thought about belgacom the 60 000 who replied said the biggest problem was still the long wait for service from installation of a telephone to a simple directory inquiry kok has moved fast to find solutions to these problems belgacom was late in the process of transformation he says that s why we were in a hurry the dutch french scandinavians even the swiss started their transformation programmes earlier than we did which was a pity because in the late 1960s belgacom was one of the leading operators in europe kok has tried the tempers of his political and boardroom bosses some of whom he believes were still steeped in the public sector culture in late 1992 only 11 months into the job his management particularly of the financial personnel and mobile telephone dossiers came under fire from the board kok says he had difficulty coping with the interventionist attitude of some directors and admits that at first he felt he had more support from below than above it was extremely difficult for me to implement immediately what i call a private sector model of authority and duties says kok in the beginning the board perceived its authority as going far more into operational responsibilities than is done in the private sector kok says the situation has been improved but not resolved certainly his position no longer seems as precarious as it was painted 18 months ago he is no stranger to combat between executive and non executive directors at swift which he joined in 1973 he struggled in vain with the organisation s dominant bank shareholders who resisted his proposals to restructure the board invest more power in the executive directors and expand the network to users other than banks at belgacom kok also has to contend with the possibility that the government may launch a premature privatisation the finance ministry has repeatedly hinted at partial flotation as part of its modest four year privatisation programme which ends in 1996 that is a short term challenge which kok could clearly do without although a fast worker he believes a hasty privatisation could do more harm than good as he put it in a speech in december last year privatisation should be based on a clear decision of the government to go for it and then be built on a scenario of careful trade offs between investment social and budgetary concerns and especially appropriate timing kok s main priority now is to seek other international partners he has already overcome some internal opposition his executive committee warned him that giving pacific telesis a

advantage of the new rules however is that investors can become involved where they could not under bes if you can take an active part in growing the business it s a way of removing some of the risk from unquoted shares especially if you have managerial experience i will only look at companies where i can add value such as through advice guidance and the benefit of having done it before if someone just wanted a sleeping partner i would not be interested i also want to like the people involved the other thing i shall be saying on wednesday is only invest what you are prepared to lose of

aims to support companies employing fewer than 150 people we want them to have the advantage of every possible resource to adapt their products to meet market demand as they swing away from defence he says other konver projects in the three counties include feasibility studies for the reuse of redundant military bases and a business networking scheme one of the most significant projects which won a grant of pounds 240 000 is for a technology and innovation management team co ordinated by western development partnership its aim is to develop a flow of technology between industry and higher education institutions it will offer advice on new product development and marketing and refer small and medium size companies to colleges or other institutions for help with for example product

discretion of the counsellors companies will be able to exchange the vouchers at colleges or research centres to meet half the cost of specialist work and services the konver funding is the first time the three counties have benefited from any government or european funded initiatives for economic diversification but compared with the scale of the task in adapting labour skills and encouraging

every aspect of the skills composition and behaviour of boards of directors the guidelines say directors have four primary tasks to establish a company s vision mission and values to set strategy and structure to supervise management and to be responsible to stakeholders the standards also establish principles for chairmen to ensure that the structure of the board is correct and is run in an efficient manner the guidelines are likely to meet opposition from many companies which feel that the behaviour of boards is something that should vary from one company to another and does not lend itself to fixed rules mr john harper development director at the institute and co author of the report said that although the standards did not hold out a promise to make every company outstandingly successful they offered a generally applicable checklist against which companies could measure their performance mr harper said the lists of requirements for directors were based on the views of hundreds of board directors interviewed over the past year he said that if one board member lacked certain attributes other board members should be found who possessed them the guidelines are being

missiles around the world 17 5 tonnes of highly enriched uranium from a few dozen european research reactors might seem small but a five year gap during which the us stopped taking back the spent heu it had supplied to these reactors has created a crisis with ramifications far beyond the world of nuclear research the row over spent fuel has its origins in a bargain struck by the us in the 1950s and renewed in the nuclear non proliferation treaty to discourage other countries from embarking on nuclear bomb research the us would help them to benefit from non military applications of nuclear technology such as the production of medical isotopes or neutron scattering investigations of the structure of metals or ceramics to keep highly enriched uranium which fuels some research reactors and which could be used to make a nuclear bomb in safe hands the us agreed to take back the used fuel that it had supplied in 1978 it went a step further with the reduced enrichment for research and test reactors programme or rertr under which operators of reactors were encouraged to convert from heu to low enriched uranium which could not be directly used for bombs rertr has had considerable success and only four european research reactors have not begun at least to convert to leu it s one of the unsung victories of non proliferation says mr alan kuperman of the nuclear control institute a washington anti proliferation group in 1988 however the us left european reactor operators in the lurch when it stopped accepting spent heu after a law suit brought by the sierra club a san francisco based ecology group had challenged the environmental safeguards surrounding the disposal of the fuel the us state department pressed hard for a resumption of the spent fuel programme a breakdown of the international consensus on conversion of research and test reactors to leu and a return to an heu fuel economy would undermine 15 years of intensive us non proliferation efforts on this matter and substantially reduce the ability of the us to influence nuclear policy in bilateral and international fora mr warren christopher secretary of state warned but the us energy department let the standstill on accepting spent fuel drag on until last summer when mrs hazel o leary energy secretary announced a new three part policy this comprised a special waiver of environmental review requirements for reactors facing a real emergency an accelerated environmental assessment to allow the us to take back a limited amount of spent fuel from reactors facing near term difficulties a full environmental impact statement to allow the us to resume taking back all the spent heu it has supplied and to take back spent leu for a 10 year period as an incentive to more reactors to convert from heu to leu the environmental assessment due to be completed by the end of next month proposes the acceptance of 448 spent fuel elements from reactors in austria belgium denmark germany greece the netherlands sweden and switzerland for storage at the energy department s savannah river facility in south carolina the nine reactors face a variety of problems that mean they cannot wait until the longer environmental impact statement covering the acceptance of about 15 000 fuel elements has been completed at the end of 1995 some have simply run out of storage space for spent fuel others face regulatory constraints they could be pushed into abandoning the rertr programme and converting back to heu or could be forced to shut down two operators germany s gkss and belgium s sck cen have already resorted to shipping spent heu for reprocessing at the uk atomic energy authority s dounreay plant in scotland although mrs o leary gave emergency clearance for sck cen last year the belgian reactor chose dounreay us officials say they have no qualms about the physical safety of dounreay but they worry that reprocessing which the us itself abandoned in 1988 would perpetuate the use of heu the belgian plant cannot convert to leu for technical reasons involving the level of neutron flux it requires but is frustrated at the difficulties of dealing with the us as a supplier of fuel we prefer to continue to be supplied by the us but if these discontinuities persist we may have to look to other suppliers including russia warns dr carl malbrain director general of sck cen gkss has converted to leu which cannot be reprocessed but has told the us that it has so little faith in its long term reliability that it may shift back to heu so that it can continue to use dounreay for many plants however converting back is not even an option because the dounreay plant has to send back the resulting reprocessed fuel and radioactive waste to the country of origin this rules out countries such as denmark and austria which do not use nuclear power and so have no plan for long term storage of highly radioactive waste we are extremely dependent on a solution that is basically doing what we were doing for the last 20 years says dr klaus singer director of the risoe reactor in denmark european reactor operators say there has been a noticeable improvement since the clinton administration took over in the us at the beginning of 1993 though they are unsure as to whether this is due to new people and policies or because the problem had become so serious that it could no longer be avoided they were encouraged by a meeting in washington 10 days ago about the short term acceptance of their spent fuel but many doubt whether the longer term environmental impact statement

and others have all signalled the need for big cuts in state spending each gulf government faces a tough task since either cutting spending or raising revenues through higher fees on state provided services income taxes in the gulf are politically inconceivable would mark the first time in recent history that these oil rich kingdoms emirates and sheikhdoms have had to face eroding the panoply of benefits each offers their nationals kuwait s task however is perhaps the stiffest since unlike its neighbours the government has an elected parliament to deal with and it already appears that the opposition dominated national assembly is in no mood to fall easily in line with the government s austerity calls such calls have been issuing with increasing shrillness from kuwaiti policymakers a measure partly of the worsening outlook for state finances but partly also of the government s appreciation that for the first time in its experience it must persuade a strong and recalcitrant parliament mr nasser al rodhan the finance minister has recently begun using such uncharacteristic kuwaiti words as urgent reforms and sacrifices the reason for such calls is plain enough kuwait had already budgeted for a kd1 2bn pounds 2 7bn fiscal deficit for 1993 94 before oil prices weakened in january however mr al rodhan revealed that at the midpoint of kuwait s june july fiscal year the state had already reached 67 per cent of the budgeted deficit worse soft crude prices forced the government to revise its calculus for oil revenues 89 per cent of state income from 1 74m barrels per day of oil sold at an average dollars 15 a barrel to 2m barrels a day sold at dollars 10 50 a barrel this implies a big cut in revenues though since the official budget includes neither defence spending nor investment income it is impossible accurately to forecast the budgetary gap for 1993 94 however senior officials say they expect kuwait to manage this deficit from its own resources partly through domestic treasury bill sales and partly from overseas investment income kuwait s overseas holdings were slashed from just under dollars 100bn before the gulf war to nearer dollars 35bn today in a fire sale to finance the war s costs but the remaining holdings earned a return of around 20 per cent in 1993 thanks largely to bullish world equity markets last year our assets grew at a rate more than enough to pay for the deficit says mr ali rashid al badr managing director of the kuwait investment authority but problems lie ahead kuwait cannot rely on continued buoyancy in world equity markets any more than on a sharp recovery in crude prices but state spending will rise in 1994 95 as kuwait starts repaying principal on the dollars 5 5bn syndicated loan taken out after the gulf war adding dollars 2 7bn to annual outlays under such additional pressure kuwait apparently has little option but to cut spending elsewhere or to raise revenues either would mean impinging on the high salaries subsidised services and other comforts which put kuwait among the most padded welfare states in the world more than 95 per cent of employed kuwaitis for instance work in the public

believe this is unsustainable sheikh salem al sabah the central bank governor says kuwaitis will have to suffer over the next two to three years we have no choice the problem will be convincing kuwait s national assembly which through a combination of its own industriousness and the diminished authority of the ruling al sabah family since the gulf war has become the most powerful in the state s history it has already passed laws mandating parliamentary scrutiny of some state investments has investigated allegations of corruption and mismanagement in kuwait s spanish investments and is seeking further to expand its powers of veto and supervision government budget proposals will have to be approved by the national assembly in spring but talk of cuts and other radical solutions to kuwait s economic straits is unlikely to win much sympathy the government has begun to air such notions as privatisation and direct foreign investment even in the country s strategic oil industry but mps see privatisation largely as a process likely to cost kuwaitis jobs talk of even limited foreign investment in the banking sector was met earlier this month with instinctive cries of neocolonialism among mps as for the need to cut spending or raise state revenues few mps seem to consider this message has got across to most kuwaitis and fewer show much inclination to be associated with such unpopular decisions there s not yet the feeling we must do anything certainly not that we should make sacrifices says mr abdulla al nibari an opposition mp he also echoes a widely held view that a government associated with alleged fraud and mismanagement in the state s multi billion dollar investments would find itself on shaky ground if it tried to persuade kuwaitis to cut their living standards a tough and perhaps immobilising struggle between the government and the assembly is therefore in prospect with this in sight many leaders of kuwaiti society particularly senior members of kuwait s main merchant families have been lobbying the ruling family to shake up the system and pre empt a debilitating political impasse in private consultations with sheikh saad al sabah the prime minister and crown prince they are understood to have expressed disappointment with his apparent inability to impose himself on either his cabinet colleagues or parliament itself the next step in what promises to be an intricate ballet by kuwait s cautious ruling family its dogged parliament anxious economic policymakers and some increasingly frustrated merchants may well be a cabinet shake up

jeopardised if nato launches air strikes on sarajevo the partnership for peace envisages closer military co operation but no eventual membership or any kind of security guarantee for the countries of

its own terms in budapest diplomats are very disappointed with nato s stance on bosnia we allowed them to fly awacs over our territory then they simply gave the impression they expected us to allow

pressure on serbia to recognise the rights of the minority and ensure their safety the diplomat said but it should be the west which should shore up our democratic structures while russia would probably want something in return if it helped us that might involve hungary s easing sanctions on serbia which budapest would be loath to concede mr kozyrev s trip to warsaw will be even more

handful have read brave new world revisited you should try it especially if you have just handed a small boy only five or six years old one of india s untouchables a few rupees in a delhi street and have watched his scabbed little face light up with a smile of disbelief huxley was much exercised by over population this was not the space age but the age of over population in the brave new world of his fable he wrote the problem of human numbers in relation to natural resources had been effectively solved but in the real world the problem was becoming graver and more formidable with every passing year it is against this grim biological background that all the political economic cultural and psychological dramas of our time are being played out that quote is from the first chapter of brave new world revisited it is in the second chapter that huxley really let rip and he did so by venturing into areas that are simply not discussed today in his brave new world he said eugenics and dysgenics were practised systematically betas alphas and even alpha pluses out of one set of laboratory bottles biologically inferior almost sub human creatures from another set in the real world we did nothing systematic about our breeding but in our random and unregulated way we are not only over populating our planet we are also it would seem making sure that these greater numbers shall be of biologically poorer quality under the conditions now prevailing every advance in medicine will tend to be offset by a corresponding advance in the survival rates of individuals cursed by some genetic insufficiency result no improvement or perhaps a deterioration in average health standards and perhaps a decline in average intelligence going further huxley quoted a dr wh sheldon as claiming that it was the fashion in some academic circles to assure students that the alarm over differential birth rates is unfounded that these problems are merely economic or merely educational or merely religious or merely cultural or something this is pollyanna optimism reproductive delinquency is biological and basic what chilled me especially as i stared through the windows of my tourist coach in delhi was huxley s conclusion what he asked about the congenitally insufficient organisms whom our medicine and our social services now preserve so that they may propagate their kind the wholesale transmission to our descendants of the results of unfavourable mutations and the progressive contamination of the genetic pool from which members of our species will have to draw is obviously bad huxley didn t

limited and impossible old man i suspect that the majority of men become selfish demanding and impossible in their old age unless they have managed to do so earlier but some of the stories that

beautiful sibyl under her own painting of a church hewn from the rock in old cappadocia her dark feline eyes were highlighted with ochre and there were long scratches on her bare forearms two fluffy burmese cats skidded about the floor in the centre of the contemporary elegant room stood a bust of the emperor hadrian dionysiac masks grinned from the walls cretan snake goddesses and steatopygous figurines adorned the mantelpiece a three eyed mexican cat with human paws guarded the fireplace we were in the house of liz greene doctor of psychology jungian analyst and scholar of astrology dr greene had been hesitant about this visit now she sat quiet and composed on the edge of the sofa occasionally leaning forward to light another cigarette i asked her is the world suffering from pre millennial tension yes certainly but i call it collective anxiety there is certainly an enormous amount of it around what is the anxiety about i think you can only partly explain it by millennial fantasies we have very funny ideas about millennia i think it is deeper than that there are it seems to me very profound changes taking place in people s perception of reality world views she said had a finite span and the world view which we have been relying on the scientific world view is showing serious signs of wear why should we notice that we still have a collective psyche we are still plugged into if you like a unified life which i think all human beings share there is something which connects us it lies behind mass movements and the appearance for example of the same mythologies in different parts of the world meanwhile the 2 000 year old moral fabric of christianity was falling to bits liz greene speaks slowly and softly like a sleepwalker in a gentle american accent acquired from a childhood in new jersey she went to university in boston and los angeles then having an english father and feeling culturally european moved to england 20 years ago was this pressure for change coming from humanity or from some cosmic or divine force they could not be separated she replied psychology might use neutral language but i don t see a lot of difference between what jung called the collective unconscious and what religion calls god scientific knowledge prevented us from going back to the ancient world of myth we had lost something en route you see a tremendous reaching out for answers people are desperate for something that will make the anxiety go away so they come to psychotherapists they come to us to astrologers to priests to fundamentalist religion to political ideology they come to isms collective anxiety and cosmic pressure might just be inventions of the psychiatric industry i said if not pre millennial tension then post copernican depression that s an attitude one can take she said i don t think it helps a lot it s like blaming advertising for something becoming popular i had read a feminist theory that collective anxiety is a men s crisis was the gender war if such it be a symptom greene said she understood the idea but did not subscribe to it i think it s a symptom of scapegoating the most characteristic manifestation of anxiety she mentioned germany and the jews it s particularly ugly but very human talk of gender wars bred hatred and made the problem worse i pointed to the pagan images around her room and asked if the occult played some part in her worldview the objects are here because i like them the images of ancient gods are symbols not actualities and are imaged beautifully that s why i collect them not because they are altars at which i sacrifice black chickens she smiled suddenly her mouth describing a great v it has nothing to do with magic or witchcraft i mean astrology was never occult as everyone ought to know our equinoctial point is shifting out of pisces into aquarius the age of aquarius starts about now give or take 50 to 70 years depending on which star you pick astrological shifts coincide with changes in religious beliefs attitudes and values greene said aquarius being a collective type of sign is appropriate for conglomerate activity such as the european union multinational companies even superstores are you saying there is a causal connection no i don t think that we are being made to do anything because it s the age of aquarius there isn t an out there and an in here they re part of the same thing so planetary patterns do seem to synchronise with changes that take place in individuals and collectives she said there was a uranus pluto conjunction portending upheaval in the 1960s people may have been demonstrating in paris i objected but what upheavals were there in indonesia or among eskimos i am not a world historian you would expect to find something happening but it would only happen within the structure that indonesians or eskimos built orthodox scientists scream bloody murder about this kind of thing that s their problem not mine now she actually laughed liz greene can afford to laugh probably half the world including ronald reagan consults horoscopes nor are all modern scientists hostile the french researcher michel gauquelin is reported to have found compelling statistical evidence of zodiacal congruity among individuals does it matter how it works of course i would like to know but i m not going to lose sleep over it do you expect the link to be discovered one day yes i think it will but i suspect it s going to require an opening up of the scientific frame of reference for measurement liz greene sometimes uses astrology to help her identify the probable crisis points in her patients lives i asked if she was not worried she would impose her unorthodox beliefs on vulnerable clients of course i m concerned with that i think any intelligent therapist is that was why responsible analysts underwent analysis it may be just another symptom of our anxious transition to aquarius that psychotherapy has come in for a lot of stick therapists have been accused of feeding off their clients encouraging selfishness even breaking up families i asked liz greene if she was aware of it well i m aware of fay weldon she laughed again weldon is bringing out a novel affliction based on the story of her husband s defection to a female analyst greene was not sympathetic he probably had a great many other reasons for going i think he heard what he d been waiting to hear nor did people go to analysts casually except perhaps in the woody allen world she said it was too expensive for that both emotionally and financially how far should one person poke inside the personality of another as much as the person needs but i think the psyche limits itself i think we all have a kind of inner sanity which tells us when something is not functioning properly and when it s ok is not introspection an unhealthy substitute for what used to be extrovert worship of some deity i don t think it s a substitute and i certainly wouldn t call it unhealthy but as we can no longer find god out there it s not a bad idea to find something like it inside to discover some kind of inner morality or integrity or ideal which is worth living for beneath the inner distress she said was something more intelligent than the person is on the conscious level what we used to call the soul yes if you like is psychotherapy a voyage of self discovery for you as well certainly i find people quite miraculous my sense of if you like the soul keeps getting reaffirmed every time i work with someone you see something mysterious and remarkable coming alive in them liz greene studied stage and costume design but found the actors more interesting than the plays she also suffered a crisis at university and problems with relationships she would not tell me more i asked for her star sign it is virgo so your account of the world is one that suits your temperament of course it suits me or i wouldn t espouse it you don t claim any more for it than that i could be wrong about the collective anxiety i could be wrong about all of it i can only tell you what i have observed i draw the conclusions that fit my frame of reference whether it s absolute truth i haven t the foggiest idea but it is a very rich and meaningful frame of reference not only to me but has been for 4 000 years to minds far better equipped than mine i m in good

insurrection because his fine qualities included extreme brutality no doubt no doubt i said but we abandoned even the mildest torture decades ago after the sunday times discovered that prisoners were being made to stand against a wall yes we have tried locking up all suspects including the innocent but as you said in 1513 that sort of thing foments unrest and you no longer exact tribute from their

benefits as in great britain even though they generate less wealth so you must pay yes pounds 3 200m a year plus another pounds 400m for an army to stop them killing each other that is about pounds 43 a week per head machiavelli looked puzzled so i explained we give every person in northern ireland the equivalent of a 20kg sack of silver each year his lip curled you are much loved for this no powerful americans believe the irish are still enslaved and send them money for explosives the irish think state benefits are theirs by right as people do in england the protestants fear we will take away their privileges and the catholics grumble because so many cannot find work you pay them even if they do not work of course especially if they do not work including the terrorists perhaps if they have no work few successful rulers have paid rebels who kill their own soldiers he said but we are a democracy nevertheless your rulers must force both sides to understand how much is being paid and exact conditions for the money this cannot be done you agree so long as northern ireland is treated like your kent perhaps the province could be given a kind of independence the protestants should then be warned that the grant will be cut unless they behave and the catholics would see that if they were to join the republic they would be very much poorer we tried this you must be more ruthless and this time get rid of the terrorists kill or imprison all that you prudently can bribe the rest give very large bribes to the leaders then they will control their comrades and inform on any who break ranks this will be much cheaper than paying pounds 400m to your soldiers of course these payments must be disguised perhaps as a rehabilitation fund run by norwegians but this is totally

and tell accounts of all the sexual rompings she enjoyed along the way nothing wrong with that of course she is not a pornographer she just has these needs and is a fastidious reporter describing for

pick her up in a van between stamata and marathon they are soon all over her but they do not get a jump mainly she tells us primly because she cannot stomach acne occasionally pitt kethley offers us an anthropological insight in greece as in england she confides the men are predominantly homosexual by inclination and although there are plenty of good looking men in athens and elsewhere there is something wrong with greek male bodies greek men hate to walk she says they drive everywhere which atrophies their legs she is equally sharp on greek pollution which is slowly but surely damaging every outdoor work of art and sharp too on greek officialdom in delphi s tourist office she encounters a woman who is remarkably proficient at not giving information in several languages which leads the author to observe that she has never yet heard any expression of regret for greek ignorance voiced by a greek what with all the sex pitt kethley s search for the ithyphallic pan the master of diverse roles who was revived in edwardian times as a figure representing raw sex and the subconscious in all its power is often lost sight of though she has her moments as a travel writer not least when describing the people of the tiny village of ano karyes on mount lykaion one of the most beautiful and mysterious of greek mountains from the top of which you can see all the mountain ranges of the peloponnese twenty years ago unknown to most of the world the people of ano karyes decided to restart the lykaian games which had a pedigree almost as honourable as that of the olympic games there are only 27 people left living in ano karyes but their passion for conservation is so inspiring says pitt kethley that since meeting them she has often wished they were running the whole country in a ruminative finale pitt kethley concludes that pan is dead in most of greece dead of pollution and the self created problems in which greece wallows but she adds not convincingly that he is alive

renaissance print by david landau and peter parshall yale university press pounds 45 433 pages the renaissance print north and south of the alps has largely been taken for granted by art historians unless as with mantegna s engravings and durer s woodcuts it is a significant part of an artist s oeuvre and necessary to the completion of a monograph few have ever considered it as art in its own right both woven into painting and drawing and standing apart from them nor have they enquired into its mass manufacture and marketing nor the artists to whom its technical development was a matter of ardent intellectual and aesthetic concern david landau editor of print quarterly and peter parshall professor of art history at portland oregon have sought to remedy this and with ten years research have produced a book that covers the subject for a century or so from the print s first burgeoning in flanders in the 1460s to its exploitation for the mechanical reproduction of raphael s imagery and from the first crude woodblock to the elegant chiaroscuros of ugo da carpi and beccafumi their approach is encyclopedic we learn of the expanding manufacture of paper from flax as the market for wool declined and that for linen grew we learn of paper merchants at a frankfurt fair of inks from vine yeast or burnt pitch of printing presses established all along the rhine and into the netherlands and swabia of family workshops in which wives and daughters played their part and the works of other printmakers were sold of networks and of agents and of hungary as a source of copper for the plates we are even told of the use of prints as objects of portable and private devotion and of their enjoyment in privacy when the market proliferated into erotica and pornography not just in illustrating the illicit loves of gods but more directly and the authors make their point with raimondi s print of a nude woman at pleasure with a ladies comforter it is at an engaging pace at the beginning that we absorb the exciting basic facts and glimpse renaissance europe feverishly exploiting a new commerce so important to their prestige that such artists as lucas cranach and urs graf may have been driven to falsify the dates of their prints so as to lay claim to primacy in technical invention but the pace is not sustained the complexities of the material defy the continuous text with which the authors bind it and like 18th century connoisseurs who know all the facts and are fecund with ideas but cannot organise either into a logical format they lose their grasp and on recovery insert the material almost at random from page 65 not under his own name but with the heading the development of a tonal system we have six pages devoted to the vexed matter of mantegna s prints a little more appears on page 100 and another five full pages are hidden in the subsequent chapter devoted to marcantonio raimondi and raphael yet in these three passages the explanation of mantegna s techniques is far from clear nor is the question of authenticity satisfactorily addressed durer provides an even more continuous leitmotiv running right through the book very late we learn that he gave his prints in barter and payment even as tips and are treated to a discussion of their financial worth and even of the coins that he carried in his purse but nowhere in the list of contents is he mentioned nor is mantegna though his compatriots altdorfer the hopfers and lutzelburger are the list of contents is one of the book s worst offences with a confusion of typefaces erratic in their relation to the importance of the subject a meaningless mixture of capitals and lower case and absurd crowding it is inadequate misleading and damnably unhelpful and the serious reader intending to use the book for reference must first set to the task of making his own list with cross references an editor should have seen to this and he should also have shaken the authors by the scruff too often they write carelessly their grammar slovenly there are only a couple of his plates known is typical and more importantly and other confusions of adjective and adverb are a common irritant no editor should have allowed to pass into print the fuzzy thinking of the brief paragraph on marcantonio and parmigianino in which appear almost certainly most scholars now agree that more probably it is not unlikely that this is not improbable and it is also possible that would have been conceivably and probably rehearsed a decade of labour by two diligent scholars does not of itself result in a good book particularly when they cannot spell martial for marshal cannot write with any style that eases the reader through their torrent of material and are so jack in the box with its presentation the design of the book is a disgrace with a rigid spine its pages never lie flat and of the twin columns of small print the inner invariably slides into the gutter crudely patched with little illustrations few pages are comfortable to the eye and the sub headings that mark the text s crucial shifts from north to south of the alps are too small to be seen when rifling swiftly through the pages as one must all this is more than irksome for so absorbing a survey of so wide a field learned technical perceptive and full of sudden and illuminating insights must be regarded as the most important work on the subject for many years certainly within my lifetime but it could have been so much more immediately useful had its publishers insisted on its being not some four hundred pages to be read as literature with some four hundred illustrations but a stout reference book we shall all use it as a reference book and every time we do so we shall curse the press that printed it\n"}, {"id": "FT941-8358", "title": "ft 19

spenders were obliged to leave their home on the cliffs near sheringham norfolk after two stray german bombs fell nearby the family decamped to a farmhouse near lake derwentwater and it was there that spender then seven years old heard his father reading wordsworth in the garden the vocabulary and the cadences of romanticism became a life long passion and it is a passion that has both enriched and hobbled his poetry worldsworth is just one of several autobiographical poems in this short collection another air raid captures a moment in 1941 when a bomb that unreasoning fury from an enemy s vision of life destroys the outer walls of a house turning what had once been private and inside a bath a wardrobe books the telephone into a public spectacle all that tender sensitive life has been

through elegies for dead friends to a long poem which examines the explosive relationship between rimbaud and verlaine what can be preserved of the intensities of the inner life in a world that seems hell bent on its own annihilation the poet according to spender acts as a mediator between the uniquely private self and the world outside us there is a lived shared reality which is both general to everyone and unique to each person and it is poetry s task to describe it unfortunately spender s abilities in this book are rarely equal to his vision air raid collapses at the end into cliche and verbal redundancy many of the other poems seem too casually written as if they are little more than notebook jottings only in the wordsworthian blank verse of worldsworth do we find a sustained and

agree that he has not achieved his life long ambition to be a great poet his more enduring achievements have been elsewhere as a writer of prose for example an autobiography world within world is his masterpiece here he has found a way with words that is much more subtle flexible and assured than most of his poetry ever manages to be marred as it so often is by a peculiar stiffness and shelleyan rhetoric as a spokesman for liberal values no matter how hopelessly privileged the spokesman may at times seem to be spender has also made his mark to argue for the sacredness of the individual and

hot coals at the feast of st panteleimon the children are all sent off by sailing boat to school in constantinople and drunken cossacks drown in the cellars they have flooded with looted wine but

aftermath the 1929 crash the second world war and yalta again and again he built up a business and a home whether in constanza or galatz or rostov or the sea of azov or novorosisk or constanza again

the bolsheviks in 1924 the iron guard in 1940 the stalinists in 1948 he made friends with the german invaders in 1940 and with their soviet successors in 1945 always he observed the golden rule of greeks abroad keep out of local politics in the end says koromila not too fancifully he followed the guidance of tiresias to odysseus to take an oar and to travel inland to the point where the oar is thought by the locals to be a spade and there to make his home in 1950 yiankos brought his family back to the mediterranean as refugees all of this is engrossing but i am a little worried about koromila s insistence that homer specifically set the odyssey in the black sea with the sirens in the sea of marmara and hades located in the cimmerian bosphorus at the foot of the caucasus this is

notably the pioneering study undertaken for the arts council by roland penrose in 1967 with the active co operation of picasso himself then 86 that too was shown at the tate but between that and this present exercise there lies a profound difference picasso painter sculptor is the first exhibition of such scale and definitive ambition to take as its subject not either aspect as a distinct if complementary practice but rather each as necessary to the other each feeding off the other and integral to the one constant creative activity picasso turned to sculpture for the first time so far as is known around 1906 a moment of transition that saw him moving from the sweeter symbolism of his early career blue and rose to something much more raw and radical now in these gently modelled heads of his mistress and companion of those early years fernande olivier we see him quietly looking sideways at his contemporaries rodin maillol brancusi and matisse we also clearly see in the paintings and drawings around us that he is looking back to the radical pictorial devices of cezanne and to the formal simplicity and energy of primitive iberian and tribal sculpture and yet he remains entirely himself already with the demoiselles d avignon that savage precursor of cubism in gestation and the simple monumental heads and figures spread all about us his own formal resolution of his several interests begins to declare itself in all its revolutionary confidence and authority the work of this first room and period alone makes the point for the entire exhibition as we move from the early sculptural nudes and heads to the first extraordinary essays into cubism and for the first time the point is made and made forcibly that cubism was not simply an exercise in reforming and reworking the idea of rendering space and form on a plane surface rather it is the essential albeit mutually contradictory interdependence of the flat and the round the real and the proposed that is being explored and celebrated by 1909 and the head of a woman fernande with its faceted disrupted almost pictorial surfaces that would yet flatten and deny its own undeniable mass and physical presence we have what is still one of the most remarkable and truly revolutionary works of the century to confront it is to be thrown straight back to the cubist drawings and paintings to which it relates and they again by the very mass and weight space and light that they conjure up on the flat surface throw us back directly to the sculpture picasso was not always engaged with sculpture through that long career but it is now clear that there was a sculptural potential or possibility in whatever he did whenever he was directly so engaged the sculpture he produced was always keyed closely in to whatever else was in hand used directly to clarify the painterly preoccupation but to use the distinction painterly at all is almost to mistake the point for it is rather the artist s preoccupation that was

picasso the mischief but fraud never given such full retrospective scope as now the quality of his transforming imagination and his technical mastery alike are manifest in everything he did as clear in every touch of paint on a surface as in every twist or fold of paper or pinch of clay or plaster a natural painter an instinctive sculptor his standing as the commanding artist of our century is

robert schifreen suggested even dos the pc s native operating system can be readily re written to make the machines a source of secure information for example it is possible to embed code in the operating system that will log all keystrokes made on a pc he says in that way log in sequences and passwords can be recorded for later use as increasing amounts of sensitive data are moved around the world using datacommunications technologies the need to maintain security and integrity becomes paramount this not only affects how users should view the weak links in their information systems predominantly the pcs being used but also security at a higher level until now this has started to look like a problem solved the us government is however currently considering throwing what many see as a large spanner in the works in the form of what is generally referred to as the clipper chip technology currently many companies regularly employ a data encryption technology known as des the data encryption system this is one of several alternatives that are ironically published specifications this would seem to degrade their value but as schifreen put it everyone knows how des works but it is not easy to crack it can be done but it would need a team of programmers a year and a cray supercomputer to do it by being a published specification everyone knows the weaknesses of des and works to plug them the us government is currently considering an alternative to these encryption systems based around a hardware chip known as the clipper chip which would contain the encryption algorithm a company using the chip would then be able to pass encrypted data to any other using the same system what has upset users according to schifreen is the fact that the us government is considering passing use of this cia developed encryption technology into law all us datacommunications users would then be legally obliged to employ clipper which would mean that recipients around the world would also be obliged to use it what makes the situation worse is the fact that clipper is a proprietary system and that the cia has written a back door into the technology allowing information to be decrypted the fear is that either through theft or the actions of a disgruntled employee this code could fall into the wrong hands another fear is that because it is from the cia the backdoor code may be made available to other national authorities perhaps most important of all however is that because it is a proprietary solution its method of working and its weaknesses remain unknown as all encryption systems are ultimately breakable this is being seen as a serious potential weakness of the system as pcs become more prevalent as a strategic tool other weaknesses may serve to compound the potential problems of clipper encryption for example access control on pcs is still a weak area though there are now products available to solve the problem if companies are willing to make the investments necessary this may be significant for the most comprehensive solutions can cost up to pounds 1 000 per pc many new pcs come with access control available as standard but these tend to be simple password systems where the password is stored in a battery backed cmos memory removing the battery therefore will normally circumvent the password investment in security is a key factor not always considered by users this starts with education about the simplest access issues for example it is rare for thought to be given to individual passwords and most people make obvious choices many users choose words like fred secret password and letmein schifreen said which are easy to guess even unix systems increasingly popular both as workstations and servers suffer access control weaknesses for example there is a well known bug in unix mail which will allow embedded code in a mail message which runs when the message is read the code can for example request the system to transmit the receiver s password file back to the sender it can also be used to transmit a complete system s password listing this contains user ids and their apparently safely encrypted passwords there are however shareware products available such as websters a program with 234 000 unique english words which when passed through the unix encryption algorithm will produce a table against which the encrypted passwords can be compared and cracked using numerals in passwords usually helps solve this problem many such routes into systems can be trapped with sufficient thought and planning by users for example an increasing number of these programs are now available from bulletin board systems so access by staff to such systems must be closely monitored particularly on the larger networks one way of doing this is to audit the applications being run there is now a new class of application appearing that scans all the disks on a network to locate and report on all applications found this should include those that are hidden behind filenames that do not include the standard applications file extensions such as exe com and bas in this way systems managers can know the location of all approved applications as well as those that are not approved the benefits of this are two fold not only are potential security risk applications identified it also ensures that no illegal copies of applications are being used preventing possible legal action by the application s authors\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3296", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 survey of information and communications technology 35 new

development object oriented computing is widely acknowledged to be the future direction for software development but discovering ways to build software fast is a painstaking process", "body": "in the ultra competitive business world of the 1990s a company s ability to create new information systems rapidly is a pre requisite for survival the key is to find ways to build application software which are both flexible and scalable object oriented computing which sees an information system as a set of self contained components is the most promising approach and it is steadily gaining favour with both software developers and users fast software development is a priority for both groups a survey of delegates to last october s objectworld conference in the uk for example cited flexibility to change and reduced time to market as the two main reasons for adopting the object oriented object oriented computing is widely acknowledged to be the future direction for software development and most software developers have pledged their allegiance to the cause the object management group omg an industry organisation which promotes object oriented computing now claims 370 members and points to growing attendance at shows and exhibitions the object oriented approach is making the running at both extremes and is central to any debate on speeding up the production of software there are several reasons firstly object oriented systems are built from sets of components which can be re used elsewhere this speeds up the development of new applications and makes existing ones easier to maintain secondly object oriented systems operate in a way that makes software portable to other platforms and preserves investment in application software thirdly objects reduce the complexity of applications software by enforcing tight design disciplines most importantly object oriented development techniques make it easy to build prototype systems to demonstrate to users which is widely acknowledged as one of the keys to speedy application development i think rapid application development is as much about the approach as it is about the tools you use says mr vic morris uk managing director of tools specialist powersoft as far as possible you want to break the application down to make it easier for end users to do it themselves if you look at what many users have done with their pcs building complex applications with spreadsheets for example you can harness that talent he goes on thinking of applications in terms of objects is the key according to mr morris in the past we viewed applications as a set of functions like say an order processing system it was very structured now with objects we can think in terms of business processes and put in place applications which can support them he explains mr morris also places emphasis on the scalability of applications this means for example an application program built for two or three users on a small network should be able to cope with hundreds or even thousands of users on a much larger system we have recently re positioned our powerbuilder tool set to reflect this so you can start with a cheap desktop version and move up to a full networked version and keep the same applications mr morris says other tool vendors have taken a similar approach because it can speed up production of larger systems if you can start with small ones and scale them up all our tools are based on smalltalk so you can move from our desktop product enfin to our corporate synchrony product says mr jeff sutherland vice president of object development at software tools company easel but it is not enough just to scale up to a large number of users you need greater access to database and tools which can deliver the performance we see the answer in tools which will do 80 per cent of what a user wants automatically the users can then concentrate on the bits they understand best the business objects he says mr sutherland believes that not enough is being done to promote object technology at the application level he is part of a group of software developers pushing for the specification of business based objects we have a problem at the moment with object oriented technology people talk a lot about code re use but where is it we see the need for re usable business objects which can give different views of the way the business operates to different users says mr sutherland there are other more serious reservations about the use of object oriented design for speeding up software initially at least although object oriented is the way forward it is not a panacea it s a solid framework to build re usable code says mr paul burford a systems engineer with object oriented tool specialist next computer in the short term it is not a quick way to get more out of programmers although it reduces the number of lines of code you need to produce there is much more design input needed mr burford cites the example of the swiss bank which used next s nextstep object oriented tool to build its systems when we started at swiss bank four years ago we wrote objects that were not re usable so there was no advantage but they recognised over time that they had chunks of re usable software he says if you take a new environment it will never be quicker to start with because of teething problems but by taking an object oriented approach you have a chance to start putting in new features in a more natural way while object oriented design techniques provide a suitable framework for building applications the real productivity benefits come from software tools strategies for selecting development tools differ according to the size and data processing heritage of the individual company larger companies tend to bring in programmer productivity tools so that their information systems departments can respond more rapidly to users demands smaller companies give their users their own desktop tools many companies combine both of these approaches the result is a growing demand for tools which can support fast software development and there is no doubt that these tools will use object oriented computing as a starting point what is clear however is that finding ways to build software fast takes time\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3303", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 survey of information and communications technology 28 a central link in the

accelerate product development and just in time software which allows manufacturers to operate lean production techniques these and other technology developments now becoming available provide some clues as to what will be the it needs of the factories of the future mr graham williams managing director of at t istel s manufacturing division believes the next five years could be exciting because of the products which it vendors are offering industry in order to help to tackle key manufacturing problems the need for manufacturers to get closer to consumers has spawned the concept of the extended enterprise in which not only suppliers but also distribution is included for example says mr williams it can be used by brewers as a means of viewing the hop grower and also the public house as part of its enterprise similarly the generation of electronic point of sales data can produce a works order and in turn create all the orders for materials and sub assemblies this would aid the lean production process as manufacturers would only be making what their customers were buying all the technology to do this exists says mr williams indeed it is already happening to some extent in the food industry and will start to happen very quickly in the process industries mr cliff shuker managing director of at t istel s rover division sees an increasing need for it applications that can be applied horizontally across processes rather than simply used to improve the performance of individual functions or departments also as customers increasingly dictate what happens in factories they will use it to inject their requirements straight into manufacturers production schedules moreover the development of massive databases provides the basis for neural networks which can aid decision making by tapping into past experience it users in manufacturing too have been thinking about the next steps in their use of manufacturing technology the most important initiative among users is the

chess programs which were used to demonstrate the power of electronic brains in the 1950s to the multimedia shoot em up video games of today programmers have used games to push the envelope of software technology advances in high resolution graphics data compression animation and user interface design have often been pioneered in games software before making the transition to business games and other leisure based uses of computers have also laid the ground rules for computer generated alternative worlds or what has come to be called virtual reality vr this new strain of software now promises to open exciting applications in business one way to see vr is as a magical window on to other worlds from molecules to minds another way to see vr is to recognise that in the closing decades of the twentieth century reality is disappearing behind a screen writes howard rheingold in his book virtual reality it could be argued that anyone who sits in front of a computer all day to do their job already spends much of their life in vr even a simple program like a spreadsheet can be engrossing enough to its user to suspend physical reality the convergence of computers and communications pushes this even further bulletin board systems and networked chatlines are now well established in the us and growing fast in europe network services like the internet cix and compuserve have created a multitude of widely dispersed electronic communities each with their own culture the phenomenon has spawned a new language a literary sub genre cyberpunk and the idea of an ultimate virtual nirvana called cyberspace there is of course not just one virtual reality but many at one extreme it is possible to become immersed in vr by using an enclosed helmet with a built in display and sensor devices which can pick up body movements at the other end of the spectrum a serious desktop flight simulator such as microsoft s package for the pc can be just as convincing vr purists argue that immersion is the only genuine vr experience and there is research into all over body suits which can take this to its logical conclusion the aim is that such a suit should act both as sensing device to transfer body movements to the computer and also to convey a sense of touch sensor suits to transmit body movement are already available at the virtual reality expo show in london in february for example the uk company virtual presence launched a 750 gram lycra suit equipped with 96 sensors and there are others available in the us work is also under way to build systems which can respond to objects in vr and transmit this sensation back to the user researchers at the university of north carolina for example have built a device which can be used to manipulate images of molecules with a full feedback system the argonne remote manipulator arm is used to explore possible combinations of molecules for new anti cancer drugs if the properties of the molecules do not allow them to fit together the resistance is conveyed back to the user as a physical force there is also some speculation in fringe literature about the possibility of direct connections from the human brain to vr systems thus eliminating the need for a suit at a more mundane and practical level less intrusive vr software is now within the reach of the pc user mainly for games but increasingly for other activities such as mail order shopping or travel planning desktop computers are now powerful enough to handle high quality three dimensional graphics and convey an impression of space it is now possible to walk around buildings which do not exist fly a jumbo jet through a thunderstorm and visit places on the other side of the world without leaving your desk the concept of vr has of course been around for some time the well established flight simulator for example has been used for training pilots since the early days of flying more recently simulated environments have been devised for other training activities such as working in hazardous environments what marks out the new generation of vr software is that it goes beyond merely representing the physical world like a flight simulator or creating a possible future with a spreadsheet vr enables the creation of worlds which do not exist and allows interaction with them this has spawned a generation of software tools which can help to visualise data in new ways superscape a vr tool from the uk company dimension has been used for example to show the effects of drugs on the human body the software allows a user to navigate around a representation of the body and see the effect of a drug down at the molecular level the market is only now becoming aware that vr products are available for low cost computing once their eyes are opened to it the ideas come rushing in we have about 30 applications built with superscape and most of them have come from customers says mr ian andrew managing director of dimension in addition to the drug simulation vr which is being used by smithkline beecham superscape has been used to build vr environments as diverse as a telecommunications network simulation for british telecom and an exhibition modelling system for dragon exhibitions although superscape can support the more exotic vr peripherals such as headsets and sensors mr andrew says that the demand is for applications which are non immersive and based on the desktop immersive vr was what caught people s imagination in the first place but most people are uncomfortable with it i d say 90 per cent of what we do is for the desktop but we have left room to support the other devices and can offer users an upgrade path when they need it he explains faberushi another uk vr specialist has built a multimedia virtual exhibition system ves which re creates the sound look and feel of an exhibition floor virtual visitors to the show can walk up to a virtual computer screen and see a demonstration of a product the interaction between people and machines is what is important about vr it lets you create spatial relationships which is very appealing people understand the rules of space says mr perry huber a consultant with faberushi proper vr allows you to move around in free form like surrogate travel mr huber also sees vr changing the way we use computers and improving the user interface one of the obvious things in the business environment is that you can get way from simple graphical user interfaces the three dimensionality lets you bring a context to data and visualise it better data visualisation in three dimensions might seem far fetched but imagine explaining what a spreadsheet program could be used for ten years ago vr offers the same potential to change the way data is viewed and presented software developers are already experimenting with the possibilities maxis a us software company has built a vr package which simulates the wall street stock exchange in the form of a casino prospective investors can risk their funds and enjoy themselves at the same time the market for vr products like these is expected to grow quickly over the next few years and an increasing percentage of revenues will come from commercial

expected to dominate throughout this period and show the largest growth another us market researcher 4th wave estimates that 70 per cent of 1993 revenues for vr products came from the entertainment sector and this will increase to 76 per cent by 1997 but commercial applications of vr technology on the desktop are likely to be the most profitable with training data visualisation and computer aided design leading the way specialised commercial applications which can harness the power of vr software will sell at a premium the parallel growth of high bandwidth telecommunications and multimedia technology both of which provide the infrastructure for vr applications promises to make the market for vr software one of the most exciting growth areas into the millennium vr could also precipitate change in wider context the pessimistic view is that it will lead to the disturbing future described by aldous huxley where people hide from the grimness of the physical world at the feelies the optimistic view is that vr will enable humans to find a richer form of communication unimpeded by the laws of the real world one thing is clear an increasing amount of communication

the local personal computer industry says mike maples executive vice president at microsoft the canadian personal computer hardware and software market is one of the most advanced in the world but

border tam says that the recent canada us mexico north american free trade agreement nafta does not make this job any easier in the canadian market we are affected by the economic situation of our giant neighbour the us as well as by the agreements and government policy of the canadian government he says nafta could affect us severely in the high technology sector although we are known to be strong in the telecommunications side we are not at all competitive in the computer market because the sheer volume is not there in canada one solution has been to sell recently developed products including a network file server system based on digital equipment s powerful alpha axp computer processor in both the us and canada as a result tam now boasts that 22 per cent of his company s annual sales are in the us with the rest in canada and in the near future he is expanding to the far east a move becoming increasingly popular among western canadian companies tam recently signed a dollars 1 5m joint venture agreement with a state owned enterprise in china it will begin manufacturing computer displays in shanghai this summer tam says that these products are being made for both the far east and north american markets in short while canada has the resources and the talent to create world class high technology companies it may have to move quite quickly to sell products outside its borders if these talents are to survive with a domestic market of only slightly more than 25m people spread over thousands of miles this is perhaps not surprising in terms of land mass canada is the second largest country in the world and distribution costs can be high but judging by the successes of delrina and the ottawa based corel corporation developer of the popular corel draw software and

communicators represent the next big computer market and for some industry observers possibly the last of the potentially large market categories for computers these small computer devices represent the logical progression of computer technologies as they move from the desktop to portable computers to the lap top and finally to the so called palm top but like much pioneering technology the first generation of these devices have so far failed to meet user expectations however there are encouraging signs that the second generation of products will overcome some of the problems apple computer was the first to coin the term pda which is rapidly turning into a generic name for small computers with communications capabilities tandy which sells the zoomer sometimes uses the term personal information assistant while ibm and at t prefer the term personal communicator they all describe a small computer that can be comfortably held in the hand or slipped into a jacket pocket with a touch sensitive screen with a pen or stylus input device and wireless communications capabilities for sending and receiving electronic mail or faxes and transferring files to a desktop computer a typical pda will include software that consists of a word processor a diary for scheduling appointments and a database to store information such as phone numbers and addresses the first pdas to hit the market were the apple newton messagepad tandy s zoomer and at t s eo communicator each has taken a slightly different approach but all are united by the fact that their sales have been far short of stellar the newton messagepad represents the most ambitious technology it includes sophisticated handwriting recognition software that turns the digital ink that is written by the user with a special stylus into computer text while the handwriting recognition technology is state of the art and works better than most previous handwriting recognition technologies its performance has not impressed most users the handwriting recognition of the newton fails to recognise many words resulting in a sometimes comical re interpretation of the users words as satirised recently in the doonesbury comic strip the newton also has problems with foreign languages especially german where average word lengths are 10 characters instead of the six characters average for english words newton has also been faulted for its communications links which do not perform as well as expected the tandy zoomer also marketed as the z 7000 by casio has avoided to a large degree the quagmire of handwriting recognition it cannot recognise cursive writing but it does have a very limited ability to recognise printed characters it prefers to store images of the user s notes instead of performing the difficult handwriting interpretation the at t eo personal communicator packs more technology into its sleek box than newton or zoomer but it is twice the price unlike the others it includes a 20 megabyte hard drive that allows it to store much more information but it suffers from a short battery life about two hours and you really need to upgrade the machine s memory to use its fax and e mail communications features all the leading pdas have been criticised for being too slow and they all use different operating systems which makes it difficult to produce a decent number of software applications the newton has its own proprietary operating systems the zoomer uses the geos software from geoworks and the eo device uses the penpoint operating system this multiplicity of operating systems makes life difficult for software developers they have to try to guess which device will sell enough units to create a large enough potential market to justify the expense of applications development and without sufficient quantities of third party software the pdas face a limited appeal despite the initial problems that have beset the first generation pdas the second generation devices promise improvements and new features that will make them more useable and hopefully will fulfil the large unit sales expectations of market researchers apple for example is redesigning the newton to add better communications capabilities and an improved operating system handwriting recognition is also improved but in what is an admission of a less than perfect system the next newton will have the option to store images of a user s notes without converting the handwriting to computer text at t stung by the disappointing sales of the eo communicator is redesigning the system lowering the price and making it more of a mobile telephone with computer features other leading computer companies are also planning pda introductions compaq computer motorola ibm and sony are just a few of the big companies that will introduce pda type devices later this year ibm s plans include a variety of pdas designed for specific tasks such as one model equipped with voice recognition for dictating documents and using a pen input device for editing another ibm pda is designed for e mail communications allowing users to hear messages spoken in a computer generated voice and to dictate a response pdas could benefit greatly from a standard user interface general magic a silicon valley based company earlier this year unveiled its magic cap user interface which is specifically designed for pda devices with communications capabilities the magic cap interface features a tiny graphical user interface using a buildings metaphor users navigate through the systems to reach different applications by choosing different types of buildings such as a post office for example to send messages magic cap is designed to work with on line services such as compuserve or americaonline and specialised on line services that use the companion telescript technology because of the small storage capabilities of pdas on line services are becoming a key factor in the success of pdas they will offer data storage services to pda customers and also carry e mail and faxes at t recently announced its personalink on line service that will support pdas and apple s eworld on line service will support newton users it is said that you can always recognise the pioneers by the arrows in their backs and although the first generation of pdas collected a fair number of arrows it is only a matter of time before the next

and has reaped considerable benefit paper movement has been drastically reduced people holding up the process have been pinpointed and cash flow has improved the paper chase used to involve an order document going to a supplier and a copy being signed off as the goods received note when the items arrived invoices were sent to the finance department in leeds which passed them to the relevant districts to be matched against the goods received notes these notes and the invoices were then returned to leeds for the details to be keyed into the payments system the documents were finally recorded on microfilm mrs christine kelly invoice supervisor recalls there was paper flying about everywhere the invoice unit installed software from image systems europe on its existing office

copying each day s work for back up goods received notes and invoices are all scanned in as they are received from districts and suppliers the order number is keyed in and stored with each document as the main reference point an order number includes a code representing the district which made the order the amounts on the invoice are also keyed in and put through a validation program to ensure for example that the figures add up and that the vat has been calculated correctly this information has to be keyed in because document scanning systems handle complete images and cannot recognise individual parts of different documents to capture an address or total figure when the system receives an invoice it uses the order number to search for a matching goods received note if it does not find one it automatically directs a query to the relevant district office where staff can access the central optical disc system through their own pcs matched invoices are passed automatically to the payments system on the region s icl mainframe computer the mainframe link is also used to retrieve information such as supplier details from central files the system has brought significant staff savings and enabled fewer people to deal with the same amount of work while providing better service the paper chase has been largely eliminated and keyboard data entry and verification have been

"body": "like many computer terms systems integration is hard to define at one level any computer based information system must be integrated or it will not work but the term has come to refer to a particular class of computer system that is one which is assembled from a set of components in a way which hides the technology from the customer the importance of systems integration as a discipline has grown steadily since companies began the move towards open systems a system does not of course need to be open to require integration but this is where the largest demand is proprietary systems are also integrated but most of the integration is performed by the manufacturer and the system is sold as a complete solution open systems bring the advantages of user choice and flexibility but there is a price to pay they are constructed from hardware and software components which are usually sourced from several different manufacturers they will almost certainly involve the use of a technological design framework which separates systems functions into users and services this approach is usually referred to nowadays as client server computing advanced skills are a pre requisite to bring these components together to create coherent and useful applications systems integrators must have a wide knowledge of componentry and how it may be brought together successfully they must also have strong software development skills because integrated systems invariably require some custom built components to meet the application need the perceived demand for systems integration has attracted a growing number of supplier and services companies in the past two or three years established hardware manufacturers in particular have seen systems integration as a growth area as margins on hardware have fallen ibm dec groupe bull icl and unisys have emphasised their systems integration talents in recent years and their service revenues have grown accordingly they are not the only contenders large consultancy companies such as eds andersen consulting and kpmg have also made a large dent in the market as indeed have traditional custom software developers such as logica sema and cgs successful systems integration depends on a broad foundation of standards for both hardware connections and software compatibility some standards are drawn from formal efforts by international standards bodies such as the international standards organisation iso and the american national standards institute ansi but many of the standards which make integrated systems possible have evolved from proprietary industry standards such as ibm s sql database standard which is used to link desktop data tools to database servers given the importance of open systems standards it is no surprise that the lead in systems integration has come from the public sector the procurement policies of government departments have pushed the cause of open systems and put many of them in the front line the uk government s decision to force open systems by legislation has been good for the systems integration market says mr philip crawford uk managing director of groupe bull he goes on to say that there are other reasons why the demand for systems integration has grown faster in the government sector than in the commercial sector for the last two years companies have been holding off making large investment decisions because of the recession and obviously the recession hits commercial world much more than it hits the government sector mr crawford adds that this has depressed the market but that there are signs that this is starting to change the market has probably grown at around 15 per cent when two years ago we expected it to be more like 40 per cent but it is now being driven by the user the demand for systems integration is coming from the user because they are crying out for usable power this demand is manifested in the demand to integrate desktop pcs into existing systems the pc is obviously the best way to deliver usable power to the desktop mr crawford warns however that there are dangers the pc is two different tools if you think of it like a car it is excellent for driving around town but it is also pretty good on the motorway good systems integration makes sure that the corporate strategy the motorway does not overwhelm the desktop he explains groupe bull s systems integration strategy like many others is based on developing the right combination of technical skills and relating these to business problems it also sees the wisdom of securing alliances with other important players in the market and recently signed an agreement with software developer microsoft to integrate pc software with its own larger systems this is more than a marketing agreement we have had to work hard to prove to microsoft that we have the integration skills and the support services to do the job says mr crawford the deal will give groupe bull advanced access to important microsoft developments such as the windows nt operating system which looks set to be a leading component in future client server systems this level of software is increasingly important to the success of systems integration as indeed is the move to object oriented computing which will help to enforce standards for software components despite this systems integration will never be easy especially as the number of choices open to users increases users have developed an attitude which means that they expect information technology to support them whereas a few years ago they had to put up with what they were given but because of openness there are far more decisions to make now and it is certainly is not getting any the less complex observes mr crawford systems integrators are therefore in the unenviable position of having to keep up with every new technology development at the same time as meeting the growing demands of increasingly educated users for this reason systems integration is likely to remain an expensive option for the foreseeable future\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3313", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 survey of information and communications technology 18 history often repeats itself the uk s computing industry the development of the uk s computer manufacturing industry ran into problems from the start genius was let down by poor marketing and lack of government funding", "body": "fujitsu s takeover of icl in 1990 brought an end to a uk owned computer manufacturing industry which dated back almost 40 years yet according to some of its early leaders who met at london s science museum at the end of last month to discuss why the early uk promise was not fulfilled the fact that the industry had survived even beyond the 1960s was quite remarkable the packed meeting organised by the computer conservation society highlighted the uk s disadvantages from the very early days the uk s contribution was out of all proportion to its population and industrial capacity said mr george davis who worked at the national physical laboratory on the ace automatic computing engine this was true at all stages the creation of basic concepts the research and development leading to the first computers and the emergence of a computer industry with competing suppliers but mr davis argued that the breadth of this contribution meant that the uk industry was too diverse from the start by the mid 1950s there were eight computer manufacturers they included ferranti english electric ict international computers and tabulators elliott brothers and leo computers this last was the product of j lyons extraordinary expansion from tea shops into building computers lyons is credited with being the first organisation to run commercial applications notable among these were bakery production monitoring in 1951 and payroll in 1954 these landmarks inspired the economist to publish a feature article in 1954 which asked is this the first step in an accounting revolution or merely an interesting and expensive experiment the trouble was that the us with a similar number of manufacturers had a far bigger home market on which to build the foundations for its industry and more government support while the us government was supporting research and development in the late 1940s and early 1950s with guaranteed orders at the end the computer industry was not seen as significant in the uk and was not supported george davis told the computer conservation society this was underlined by the practical experiences of mr cecil marks who recalled being seconded by royal ordnance where he worked on administration and accounting using punched card equipment to a study carried out by government departments into the potential uses of computers scientists and users from several departments including the treasury worked for 18 months culminating in the production of a hefty report and a meeting with a very senior civil servant at the end of the meeting he suggested that this was not the time to be getting into computers mr marks said that led to the ordnance factories at least losing ground for more than 10 years other factors were brought to light by mr hugh ross who set up ferranti s london computer centre in the mid 1950s he pointed to a dispute between ferranti and the national research development corporation over manufacturing costs underwritten by the publicly funded corporation which led to a nine month ban on sales as mr ross said this had a crippling impact on uk success in the emerging market as well as hitting ferranti s cash flow but mr ross also blamed an absence of financial management for ferranti s failure to fulfil its early promise even when he set up the london computer centre he said he never had to account for any money he spent indeed he had never had a budget in the first place later when he was responsible for ferranti s pioneering documentation service one of the biggest spending units mr ross again had no budget moreover he had never had to produce a business plan and was never called to account there was no financial management at all he said i later joined stc and came in contact with management training provided by its owner the us itt group mr ross added this was terrific and a profound shock after ferranti we had to produce business plans prepare budgets and report our monthly results against those budgets such personal reminiscences add flesh to historians reports on uk genius being let down by everything from poor marketing to lack of government funding compared with the us france and germany whatever the combination of factors george davis showed how us manufacturers took firm control within a dozen years of j lyons running that first payroll system by 1967 ibm had installed over 21 500 computers of various sizes uk market leader ict soon to become icl had sold 844 these included 399 of the new 1900 range which was to be the company s mainstay until the middle of the 1970s meanwhile ibm s system 360 launched the same year was already up to 5 730 installations in 1968 icl was formed as the great white hope the culmination of merging the computing activities of all the early manufacturers yet it was still dwarfed by ibm george davis showed that in 1969 icl had a pounds 115m turnover and spent pounds 13m on research and development while ibm had a turnover of pounds 3 000m and a research budget of almost pounds 170m however a retired icl executive director mr peter hall stoutly defended icl s record icl and its ict forerunner had been profitable for 35 years apart from in 1965 just after taking over ferranti s ailing computing operation and in 1981 when the visionary dr robb wilmot was transforming the company for the emerging office computing revolution mr hall said fujitsu allowed icl to run itself and that the company generated all its own cash for takeovers and other investment and did all its own design work whether that makes icl any more british than ibm uk or rover group in the car industry for that matter is debatable but mr hall argued that these points suggest that the early promise of the uk computer manufacturing industry which had mostly merged into icl by 1969 was fulfilled after all it is simply that a generation later the industry is all in foreign hands as today s tight margins on hardware increasingly cause computer manufacturers to look to software and services for their profits it is equally debatable whether the virtual disappearance of a uk computer manufacturing industry need be a cause for concern that concern is now focused more on the software industry where some big names have fallen into foreign ownership takeovers of cap hoskyns istel scicon and others have

culture case study two companies break new ground", "body": "facilities management agreement between bp exploration europe bpxeu in aberdeen and andersen consulting broke new ground for both companies in effect bpxeu outsourced not only the it department and the accounting software it had used but the actual accounting function and staff as well the decision taken in the early 1990s affected the entire accounting services of the uk and the continental shelf operations a pounds 12bn business worldwide employing some 7 000 people another unusual aspect was the extreme secrecy of the arrangements the 300 accounting staff affected were not told until after months of negotiations and hammering out details of the facilities management fm contract the driving force for bp exploration towards facilities management was the need to cut down all expenses by 30 per cent tom wright control and planning manager at bpxeu explains the pressures brought about by the collapse of oil prices since the early 1980s we realised we would have to radically alter the way we did business to remain competitive we had to reduce costs 30 per cent across the board he says it was a requirement for every manager to achieve that within three years without compromising health and safety the core skill for bpxeu was its business of oil exploration and a hard look at the accounting services revealed that a line could be drawn between what accounting information was truly necessary in house and what was not it is vital that we have that information for making policy and interpreting business information but not that we provide it ourselves says mr wright similar styles is the reason he gives for the choice of andersen consulting which already had a track record at bpxeu when news of the announcement broke in june it was a brand new idea for both companies andersen was to take over accounting staff as well as it staff and computer assets initially there was shock even anger however we had prepared pre planned individual intensive counselling sessions and by the end of the day people understood the effect it was going to have we though that was better than months of uncertainty says wright the business was transferred under transfer of undertaking legislation which protects the employees and their rights effectively they had no choice although for some the centralisation of operations in aberdeen from the six sites previously involved pre determined the decision everyone outside aberdeen had a choice of relocation to new location or accepting severance terms says tom wright they were transferred full stop there was no choice andersen took over the staff the vax computer and mccormack and dodge now dun bradstreet millennium software used for the accounts wright himself has no doubts that the deal arranged for bpxeu accounting staff actually secured better career prospects and long term employment andersen consulting provides greater focus and incentive for the staff who feel far closer to the business if an accountant works for an accountancy company it is the focus of using the core skills in the core business that drives the difference no one believes that on day one of course but after six or seven months that is exactly what has happened the pension rights were the only thing that had to be addressed in some cases topped up to match the bp scheme for those transferring to the andersen pension scheme the key benefits are the enthusiasm and the focus of the staff it has reduced costs by creating a single interface instead of a myriad of interfaces says mr wright the real effect is that we have turned a fixed cost to a variable or at least semi variable cost as the service expands say drilling increases or new fields come online or we dispose of other assets so the cost varies now we can concentrate on the core business and it allows us to focus on the business of exploration and production it has simplified things we don t have to worry about training developing and motivating 300 accounting and support staff however there has been no abdication of decision making we take all the business decisions they provide the financial analysis and variants analysis but they don t decide what should be done the decision making is the core skill says mr wright he believes the physical distance of the andersen operation five miles away was essential to bring about a change of culture the initial contract is for four years both parties reckon on three years to get the costs down although a longer partnership is envisaged it s an opportunity to share benefits if andersen can grow the business they can bring the cost down they have the focus to do it faster and more efficiently the other thing i d emphasise is that we really did want the best for our staff we honestly believed they would have a better future than in a business where the cost pressures of the north sea were a constant threat he adds the fm contract has had one more important psychological effect he says more than anything else the move convinced everybody else inside bp that we are serious about changing the way we do business for andersen the business has grown as expected it took 317 staff from bpxeu only 30 of them computer based that s what makes this deal so unusual it s a business function management not just systems management says norman cook andersen s associate partner the head of the unit at aberdeen it now has extra customers including sun oil in aberdeen cook s view is that andersen s expertise has already brought savings he is confident that the current costs of pounds 15m per year can be brought down by pounds 5m by 1995 we ve saved a lot because we manage the bank balance tightly pounds 500 000 a year in funding charges alone bill lattimer partner in charge of market development for the outsourcing practice at andersen consulting believes this is the way fm is going the it component is of less interest to the

once dedicated to hardware or software are moving into facilities management", "body": "the ability of a company to operate or not may depend on the management of its computer system this can be the make or break factor especially as computers move close to the centre of business in areas such as manufacturing customer service and sales as well as the traditional accounting functions on this premise both factions on facilities management fm base their arguments the faction against believes the computer system is so vital to the competitive strength of core activities that it would be madness to contract it out inside knowledge expertise about computing and the business should stay that way the argument about being in the centre of things hands equal ammunition to those who promote fm in a culture where compulsory competitive tendering cct is the norm there are economies of scale in an outside or outsourced supplier providing the hardware the software and the expertise to support it cct demands that every contract decision must involve those classic elements measure and deliver dear to the heart of it professionals you can t deliver what you can t measure furthermore fm proponents argue that they are much better at knowing how much things should cost where economies can be made and delivering them undistracted by the fluctuating concerns of core operations coding programming and the support of end users are the central activities of an it department the argument runs thus how much better for individuals to be at the profit making centre of a company whose business is supplying it services than to be at the periphery of a company whose real raison d etre is baking biscuits making cars or exploring for oil it has to be said on both sides that the margins in supplying computer hardware and even packaged software have dwindled however the long accepted figure of 80 per cent of it spending is on support and maintenance stays constant the tedium of arguing about who owns a problem software hardware network has driven many a user company into single source supplier agreements and the idea of contracting out an entire it department is simply a logical step further in cost control the result is a burgeoning market in systems integration and facilities management new names for bundling activities familiar since the earliest days of computer services systems integration is a broad church it covers anything to do with development including every sort of alliance of software and hardware involved in setting up new systems fm is the contracting out of an entire task and its maintenance the contractors take over the assets and the manpower necessary to the service the research company dataquest estimates the value of the fm marketplace at more than dollars 2 500m in europe growing by 20 per cent a year this explains why some of the best known names in the computer industry are now turning to fm as a core activity they include the big traditional firms of accountants such as andersen consulting and ernst and young and names once identified with manufacturing rather than merely supporting computers unisys and olivetti for example are among the companies which once known for their proprietary hardware have turned to supplying services and support for almost any sort of hardware and software particularly the workstations and pcs termed desktop services nearly 1 000 of olivetti uk s 1 400 employees are in the customer support group working for a customer base largely in the financial and retail sector unisys has recently signed up bass taverns the uk s largest public house retailer for an fm contract worth over pounds 3 9m over three years its job is to support 2 500 pubs developing and supporting bass s central retail system in the uk other users of unisys outsourcing services include mcdonald s restaurants us users include the federal government the ford motor company and nasa hoskyns is an active fm company one of the uk s largest computer services companies worth pounds 200m part of the french owned cap gemeni sogeti group uk customers include woolworths bristol water and hoover outsourcing is still the fastest growing sector of the it services market analysts estimate that the european market will double by 1998 to a value of pounds 4bn says peter falconer hoskyns associate director falconer is looking to the european market to expand five recent contracts for hoskyns scandinavian sister company adding up to pounds 17m worth in all underline the ambition the pace at which fm is adopted will differ country by country he says cgs is well placed to benefit from this expansion because it is committed to regional as well as global service delivery he argues that in house it departments find it difficult to keep pace with the growing demands of the organisations they serve and the increasing complexity of pcs and lans is putting more strain on them according to a 1993 survey by romtec desktop services pcs their procurement installation configuration and support is the fastest growing part of fm worth over pounds 1bn by 1995 asset management network design installation and administration and the end user helpdesk all come under the desktop label the desktop is one of the prime areas targeted by bull information systems the newest arrival in the fm market which launched its athesa fm division this february see below sharing the benefits of cost saving is a convincing argument for fm but there is always concern about staff who have to change allegiance to the outsourced supplier see panel on andersen s bp contract for an example there are regulations to protect them the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations 1981 retains current terms and conditions for staff being transferred the government is anxious to remove obstacles to free market testing according to the william waldegrave the minister for public service and science speaking at a recent financial times conference on resource management the relevant provisions of the deregulation and contracting out bill now before parliament are designed to extend the scope for market testing activities in central and local government by removing obstacles to the contracting out of statutory functions this is good news for athesa and others but staff affected might not be so pleased unison the uk s biggest trade union and cms a division of british steel claimed to have broken new ground when they recently signed a trade union agreement which outlined practices and procedures to be followed when staff transferred from cambridge city council to cms a division of british steel which won the multi million pound contract in late 1993 according to mark pope cms sales and marketing manager this was an important industry first we believe it is important that our new staff have confidence in us and we in them the unison office at cambridge city council stressed the importance of contractors recognising unions if we are to be subject to the contracting out of services from local authorities then it is important that any successful contractor recognises unions cms was the only candidate that had any track record of successful relationships with unions this is a hint that the change of culture associated with working for one organisation rather than another might bring new patterns to the computer industry partnership the key word emphasised by all fm suppliers means both partners making allowances if the marriage is to last\n"},

telecommunications which is characterised by lower investment and intensifying price competition particularly in the major industrialised countries this was the gloomy prognosis for telecom equipment suppliers given by the swedish manufacturer ericsson during its 1993 results meeting five years ago this kind of outlook would have been deeply damaging for a company like ericsson in common with its rivals in europe alcatel and siemens ericsson placed a heavy reliance on the sale of switching equipment to state owned telephone companies in western europe but ericsson s focus has changed over the last two to three years mobile communications is now its core business and while europe remains an important market for sales of switching equipment ericsson is increasingly tapping emerging markets such as india and china for new sales the telecom equipment market today is undergoing rapid change both in terms of the products that are manufactured and the markets where they are sold big business users are demanding high speed broadband services to send massive volumes of data backwards and forwards between their offices scattered across the world radio is becoming the cheaper than copper for access to long distance networks and the term multimedia is causing panic among equipment vendors they will undoubtedly play a role in building multimedia networks but software is the key to multimedia and if equipment vendors fail to reach alliances with software companies they may be left behind the leading equipment suppliers such as alcatel siemens american telephone and telegraph and northern telecom are still making public switches but most state owned telephone companies in western europe and north america are now reducing their investment levels they have digitalised their long distance networks and modernisation of local networks for low spending residential customers is proceeding at a slower rate recession first in north america and now in europe has also taken its toll increasingly switch suppliers are targetting the emerging asian markets china is the biggest prize and its requirements are so immense that there is room for all suppliers ian macleod a telecommunications analyst at natwest sellier in paris calculates that in 1992 total line deliveries switch orders are expressed in terms of the number of lines that can be connected to china came to around four million he estimates that the figure doubled to eight million in 1993 and that by 1996 orders could be running at 12m lines a year to raise telephone penetration to its planned level of 10 per cent by the end of the decade china will have to buy 100m lines between 1992 and 2000 india s expansion programme will require the installation of 18m lines over the same period major suppliers to asia such as alcatel and ericsson are gradually moving manufacturing facilities into local markets there are clear benefits to be had production costs are lower than in europe or north america but this is not the prime motivating factor in many cases governments insist on local manufacture to provide jobs and prepare the way for indigenous production some governments in eastern europe make the acquisition of local production facilities a pre condition of contract awards otherwise the local manufacturers which supplied the national telephone companies during the cold war would inevitably face closure but it would be a mistake to imagine that western manufacturers are packing their bags and heading east sales into developing markets are more of an expansion than a re orientation the riches are still in western europe and north america although the importance of public switching equipment is inevitably in decline alcatel the world s largest telecom equipment manufacturer still relies on europe for 75 per cent of its sales driven by a wave of liberalisation the european telecommunications equipment market will undergo radical change over coming years the cosy relationship between state owned telephone companies and local manufacturers will be forced apart as new operators attack the lucrative international and business communications markets closed markets will open as state owned telephone companies begin to behave like proper commercially run companies and national champions such as siemens and alcatel will respond by selling their products to competitors to deutsche telekom and france telekom the uk telecommunications market is already the most liberalised in the world equipment manufacturers are widening their vision beyond bt and mercury communications and are facing immense pressure from both the new operators and the incumbents to develop new technology that gives them a competitive edge new international and long distance telephone networks are being built wireless technology is being trialled for local telephone networks and cable television operators are being allowed to offer telephone services the requirements of big business users are setting the agenda for equipment vendors coping with massive flows of data between sites has become a headache for today s telecommunications manager a surge in demand for the interconnection of local computer based networks has led to the development of a fast packet switching service for data communications called frame relay equipment vendors are facing stiff competition in frame relay from smaller companies in the computer and networking sectors such as cisco systems raycom systems and stratacom a bigger battle is being fought for dominance in asynchronous transfer mode atm a technique for sharing the capacity of a telecoms channel between those wishing to use it atm enables telephone operators to offer high bandwidth services such as high speed data or video conferencing with improved efficiency and greater flexibility atm is already being touted as the backbone for multimedia and other broadband services and can be applied to both private and public networks all leading equipment vendors are positioning themselves for a share of the atm market a group of 16 european operators in 15 countries is to conduct an atm trial this year and all have awarded atm contracts familiar names such as alcatel siemens american telephone and telegraph and ericsson have won contracts along with netcomm a uk based data switch manufacturer ericsson has prospered as a leading telecommunications equipment manufacturer in a market which is undergoing rapid technological and where a number of its rivals are stumbling alcatel siemens and northern telecom all suffered profit setbacks in 1993 they were hit by a fall in orders for public telecommunications equipment as a result of the recession in north america and europe meanwhile products based on atm and synchronous digital hierarchy its sister transmission technology are only now emerging from the laboratory and operators are reluctant to commit themselves to major orders lars ramqvist ericsson s managing director puts his company s strong financial performance in 1993 down to a strategy which meant spending 15 times more on r d than on dividends in a speech at the 1994 innovation lecture in london last month ramqvist said manufacturers needed to forego short term profit in favour of higher r d spending ian macleod at natwest sellier is confident that the combination of liberalisation and new technologies promises a new phase of growth in the world telecommunications equipment market leading equipment vendors are best placed to benefit from the growth but they will have to get the balance

telecommunications services sector but they will face a number of obstacles along the way which will slow the progress of global partnerships the main ones are us partners most multinational

the us therefore is vital two of the groupings unisource and france telecom deutsche telekom need us partners at t mci and sprint are the three obvious candidates for anyone in search of a us partner mci has already thrown in its lot with bt so this only leaves at t and sprint france telecom and deutsche telekom were in serious discussions with at t last year with a view to an alliance that would have involved a pooling of international telecommunications activities in a new company but project atlantic has broken down following suggestions from the competition authorities in brussels that it would fall foul of rules on mergers a less ambitious alliance is now under discussion but this may not satisfy the ambitions of at t unisource appeared to be lining up sprint two years ago when the two sides agreed to interconnect their data communications networks but the agreement was terminated at the end of last year after unisource lost one of its first customers swedish conglomerate skf group because of problems with the interconnection of the two networks systems integration telecommunications networks are constructed in different ways and by different manufacturers when skf group cancelled its contract with unisource it cited the failure of unisource and sprint to provide seamless network integration systems integration will be one of the main tasks facing bt and mci when they construct a global network platform customers in the us will connect on to mci s network while bt is installing network facilities in europe old friends partnerships already exist between international telephone operators when a uk company orders an international private circuit from bt for example from london to paris bt has to liaise with france telecom for the half circuit on the french side similarly international telephone operators have to pay each other for delivering calls to their customers accounts are settled according to the international settlements procedure complications arise when a country has more than one international operator for example the uk has bt and mercury while the us has three large international carriers at t mci and sprint in this case bt would divide its international outgoing traffic between the us operators according to the market share of the three operators for international calls from the us at t has roughly 60 per cent of the us long distance market so it receives 60 per cent of all incoming calls this business is highly lucrative as the settlements procedure sets prices at above cost if at t was to side against large international operators it could threaten existing relationships this explains why at t says it would prefer to offer global services in partnership with state owned telephone companies rather than in competition with them regulation few countries allow competition with state owned telephone operators in basic voice telephone services in europe restrictions will not be removed until 1998 although many companies are already exploiting uncertainties about the rules for competition in services to closed user groups global alliances will also attract scrutiny from both national and regional governmental bodies bt s acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in mci had to go before the the us state department and department of justice as well as the federal communications commission the telecommunications regulatory authority it also needed clearance from the european commission an alliance between at t france telecom and deutshce telekom would face even closer scrutiny and is the main reason for the decision of the three operators to seek a less ambitious alliance than was originally envisaged outsourcing global alliances are founded on the assumption that multinational corporations will over the next few years decide to outsource their telecommunications networks to third parties but mr lenny elefenbein the managing director of us telecommunications consultancy lynx technologies notes that while an impressive number of users have put out requests for information very few have actually awarded their businesses to one of the carriers he says that even the large carriers have been confused by the high ratio of activity to closed deals and that several of them have commissioned internal studies to determine why they they are not getting their share of the perceived big outsourcing bonanza cultures while mci is an aggressive marketing driven company bt is still making the transition from a government department nine years after its privatisation and ten years after the ending of its monopoly many observers question the ability of the two companies to work together effectively the problems will be even greater for other transatlantic partnerships other telephone companies in europe are still under state control and have not even begun to make the transition to commercially run companies that bt started in the late 1980s there will be other problems along the way many of them arising as global consortia threaten to take lucrative business contracts from state owned telephone operators in smaller countries leaving them only with the unprofitable residential customers a momentum has built up behind the formation of global alliances which will assure their emergence but there will be problems along the way and big businesses in

seismic trauma that has rocked the computer industry in the early 1990s is not just the result of a recession it is the result of a fundamental shift in technology philip manchester looks at network developments and the business benefits of client server systems", "body": "the computer industry fared well in previous recessions because companies turned to automation to save costs and cut staff but in the early 1990s it was different former giants of the industry such as ibm and dec tottered alarmingly and have yet to prove they will survive the upheaval the main cause is the transition from centralized mainframe based computing to distributed client server based computing in many ways the transition reflects a wider change which is taking place in industry generally local autonomy from the distribution of computer power and management responsibility technologically this change manifests itself in client server systems an approach to distributed computing which separates users clients and the services they use servers client server computing has its origins in database management systems dbms and the trend to separate the software used to access data from the software used to manage it during the 1980s developers created a new model for dbms which allowed these two components to be distributed across computers on a network the front end tools data query languages and local applications became known as clients and the back end dbms engines became known as servers database vendors such as oracle ingres sybase and gupta use this approach in their products with the result that they can all communicate with each other a front end tool from gupta for example can use a back end dbms engine from oracle without the user ever being aware of the location of the data client server computing extends this idea across the whole system and breaks down functions according to their role either as a client or a server addition to dbms servers a modern network will have servers to handle printing communications mass storage back up and so on this approach can bring many benefits it allows users greater freedom in their choice of hardware and software with consequent cost savings it makes systems more flexible and provides for better integration of different types of systems we have to tie the benefits to the business and i think client server does this in four ways says mr lawrence hunt director of distributed processing at the uk software company act firstly client server is much more flexible than traditional mainframe systems if you want to get data for management information systems this is difficult with closed mainframes secondly it lets you integrate application more easily you can integrate a pc based spreadsheet into a mainframe database much more easily with a client server approach thirdly client server systems give much more independence from vendors all business want to future proof their investment in applications software which probably represents 80 per cent of the cost of a system client server enables you to do this effectively finally client server systems can cut costs we were recently installed a client server system at a large investment bank the costs came to about pounds 1 5m it would have cost pounds 3m if we d had to use a traditional approach with mainframes says mr hunt other financial institutions have also opted for the client server approach in a big way the nationwide building society for example has standardised on microsoft s windows nt operating system as the lynchpin for a client server system which will support 10 000 personal computer users over the next three years it is also looking into the possibility of plugging its automatic teller machine network into the new system with windows nt as the controlling software national westminster bank has also adopted windows nt as the basis for its client server developments most organisations are adopting a cautious approach to the transition from traditional centralized computer to client server systems however paymaster formerly the paymaster general s office is typical we are introducing client server slowly function by function we have started with electronic mail and access to shared spreadsheet and are moving on to introducing more function on desktop pcs says mr derick harbottle director of information technology at paymaster after many years of relying on an icl mainframe computer to do everything paymaster has embarked on an ambitious plan to integrate up to 800 users into a three layer client server system using hardware from olivetti and software from novell and oracle the icl mainframe will eventually become no more than a database server we have a heritage of legacy systems on mainframes and we had to see if it was practical to move away from the mainframe after a rigorous right sizing study to see if it was feasible we opted for a staged approach with a pilot project to start says mr harbottle paymaster s move to client server is the result of the same commercial pressure faced by business following changes in the uk government s approach to public services and the introduction of market testing paymaster has had to become aware of the service it offers it customers we have made the change for sound business reasons we are forward looking company and need do more than sit back and let things just happen says mr harbottle he goes on to emphasise that client server should not be seen as a technology solution but a business solution which brings greater flexibility to building information systems he is also wary of expecting too much in the way of cost savings some people are talking about the technical issues or the cost saving issues we prefer to concentrate on the business benefits which will come from client server he explains any move to a new technology is bound to cause new problems and the transition to client server systems is no exception paymaster s cautious approach with carefully phased introduction of the new system alongside the old is an object lesson in how to move to client server with the minimum amount of pain we try to avoid being at the bleeding edge of technology rather than inventing our own we would rather steel other people s wheels observes mr harbottle\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3321", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 survey of information

managers have responded to the rising demand by exploiting existing systems more efficiently this is one of the main reasons for the enormous growth in sales of devices such as intelligent hubs bridges and routers in the past couple of years they have helped a lot but it will not be enough fibre distributed data interface running at 100mbps has been regarded by many as the probable solution but it has so far proved too expensive fddi and fast ethernet also running at 100mbps may be overtaken by atm asynchronous transfer mode experts now agree that atm is the only technology that can give the necessary transmission speed for communicating image voice and data together in real time at an acceptable price it can use existing wiring which will help keep down the cost it may therefore be what is needed to start the long expected spread of multimedia applications ethernet and token ring have suffered from a lack of standards which has meant a large amount of conversion of data from one format to another the move to atm which is rapidly becoming standardised may be equivalent to removing official frontier controls unlike its predecessors atm uses a technology known as cell relay which takes advantage of the high speed transmission capacity of fibre optic cables it handles data in fixed length cells rather than variable length packets which is thought to be more efficient this should push the speed of transmission up to a maximum of around 2 4 gigabits per second for backbone systems in office and factory buildings 155mbps is expected to be the usual speed 45mbps may be typical for combined data voice and video atm will not put upper or lower limits on the transmission speed but use that which is appropriate to the application other important advantages of atm are that it is a much simpler system than the older ones and can be used for both local area and wide area networks which should further reduce migration costs and ease the task of network management atm

it was necessary it has turned people s attention to atm as a local area network technology he says atm ready lan products began to come on to the market in 1992 atm on lans is forecast to prove a more cost effective solution than on wans or on the public carriers services so it is likely to be adopted for lans long before the telephone companies have worked out the details of their offerings the largest corporations will probably be the first to take up the technology banks want it in their dealing rooms where video and news agency reports may be joined on a single fibre optic feed users are only experimenting with it at the moment live applications will follow in a year or two many of the telephone companies worldwide will introduce their first atm services this year according to mr sean phelan principal analyst for market research firm yankee group europe pricing presents them with a dilemma if they price it too low they risk cannibalising their current revenues but if they price it too high the uptake will be very small he says the arrival of atm therefore represents a big opportunity for new entrants into the telecommunications business for most users the big question is when they should try to move to atm a report last year by the ovum consultancy said that potential users of atm especially in europe were cynical about it partly because current atm products did not match their expectations ovum said that atm provided far more than enough bandwidth but added that this did not translate into the functionality required one of the authors of the report mr iain stevenson says that their cynicism may be dispelled by a number of new products from hub and router vendors which will be delivered this year he notes the telephone companies are worried that atm may leave them holding the string for users who have equipment on their premises which is intelligent enough for them to manage their own networks the telephone companies have to get closer to their customers to find out what services they really want he says one of the technical concerns about atm has been that receiving devices may not be able to cope with the throughput data cells could get lost in the pipeline and need to be re sent with only a small disruption an encyclopedia could have gone by notes mr jim boyle vice president of wide area networking for ibm ibm has stated that atm is one of its key technology strategies and it is investing heavily in research into network congestion the design of atm networks will be difficult at least until flow control software matures users may

couple s regular weekly shopping order such a vision remains a fantasy but retailers believe it could be a reality even a commonplace by early in the next century what will make it possible is the conjunction of multi media technology allowing sound pictures graphics and text to come together on one screen with fibre optic technology enabling huge amounts of information to be sent at high speed to and from consumers homes technological advances in the past 20 years have revolutionised the way retailers run their businesses producing huge gains in operating efficiency but they have not fundamentally changed the shopping experience in the next 20 years however technology could revolutionise shopping itself it will change the view of shops as simply repositories for goods to be sold to the public it is also likely to break down the barriers between shopping recreation and even education the biggest growth area is expected to be tv shopping already booming in the us the cable home

as the number of available cable channels increases conventional shopping channels are expected to proliferate probably targeted at increasingly narrow age and interest groups established retailers are already seizing upon tv shopping as a potent selling force macy s the us department store group is launching a shopping channel later this year the next stage as more sophisticated communication networks are developed could be the grouping together of information providers network operators and transaction companies that would enable customers to select purchases and transmit orders to retailers via a remote control as described above an essential part of the growth of such channels is likely to be fast secure delivery of products to consumers homes posing new challenges for retailers however shops as physical entities will not die out many consumers will always want the opportunity to examine or try on products before they purchase convenience stores for top up and impulse purchases are likely to remain indispensable although they may become more specialised but stores will have to ensure they provide a value added shopping experience and come up with new attractions to lure shoppers away from their tv screens technological advances are expected soon to make shopping especially grocery shopping less onerous one way will be to end queues at check outs by developing shopping trolleys that scan purchases as customers make them and automatically deduct the cost from their credit or charge card symbol technologies and videocard have already developed a trolley with a blanket of laser beams across the top which can read barcodes of goods being put into the trolley from any angle the trolleys are being trialled in the netherlands the next step may be using silicon chips or tags which can be read by a radio beam on the trolley a prototype system has been developed by the south african council for scientific and industrial research in conjunction with the british technology group eventually however customers may not need to put goods into trolleys themselves supermarkets and other stores may display just one example of each product customers will walk around the shop and wave a wand across a bar code on the shelf to order and pay for a product their order will be assembled behind the scenes by staff surplus selling space might be used instead for cooking classes and demonstrations or multi media kiosks offering information for those who do not insist on seeing or handling every item the process could be taken further why walk around a supermarket when you could be say enjoying a meal in a restaurant making selections from an electronic shopping catalogue and picking up your order when you have finished your coffee as well as making shopping more enjoyable advances in information and communications technology will give customers more choice and control stores may no longer stock products but instead offer customers the

order the bill is paid if it needs to be verified by an engineer or a senior accountant it is sent to their computer screens electronically via digital equipment s teamlinks package once approved the

from the use of mail enabled applications where an application such as word processing or electronic forms has an e mail option built in mr ferris says automating simple business forms such as

european endorsement and despatch and binding messages are being developed for users in printing and publishing but large scale users of edi have one big problem how to communicate with even very small suppliers or customers via edi one solution is to use what is known as hybrid edi where those who aren t equipped to receive edi documents electronically receive them on paper a number of

compromise but it underlines just how difficult it is to get rid of paper when paper is accessible to every business from the corner shop to the multinational another problem is that electronic images of paper documents are not legally admissible in court even though they can include signatures and are difficult to alter for example amerada hess files copies of its paper invoices in case its

bank has coincided with fierce commercial pressures and a relentless struggle to keep overheads down it briefly served to offer a holy grail during the 1980s banks signed up for huge projects on the grounds that more information meant better business by and large they ended the decade disillusioned computers had proved their worth handling vast quantities of data but they had not come cheap and on the way banks found themselves employing a growing army of programmers and systems analysts with financial deregulation in the uk retail banks have faced new competitors abbey national is a building society turned bank lazard notes that abbey national has used computers for thirty years historically this meant large expensive mainframe machines falling hardware prices and the event of the micro processor saw computing break out of the mainframe world it was suddenly available across the board technology was a barrier due to cost now it is a gateway an enabler rather than an inhibitor that is very significant to us lazard says abbey national operates systems ranging in size and supplier large mainframes from ibm and unisys still provide the backbone for essential services such as savings current accounts and insurance packages but the advent of powerful workstations that do not require it specialists to drive them has revolutionised the branch network abbey national has recently completed a four year programme to install rings of workstations linked into local networks in each of its 685 branches these olivetti machines are tied to a dedicated communications

total of nearly pounds 200m in it large though it seems banks can no longer survive without persistent investment in it a condition lazard defines as a growing dependency on information as a product in theory it should allow banks to make better use of that information one of abbey national s computers is an at t teradata database engine an extremely powerful box dedicated to analysing customer

group the implication is that the company wants to establish its software as the global standard in multimedia just as its ms dos and windows operating systems are the world standard for ibm s design of personal computers there have been some early clues microsoft is already working with sega the japanese games console manufacturer on an operating system for a new machine although mr gates says the project is small and divorced from microsoft s mainline operating systems development some weeks ago it bought soft image a canadian company which is market leader in the esoteric discipline of software for moving picture animation the special effects in the film jurassic park are its work furthermore it has announced it intends to test its multimedia software in collaboration with tele communications inc tci the largest us cable operator a first fruit from the venture will be a new channel of programming aimed at the consumer market for computer hardware software and accessories what microsoft intends to provide is the operating software which will manage the flow of information of all kinds on to high speed networks and the software which will connect it to personal computer operating systems in the home or office it may also provide some of the applications a personal money management program for example mr gates says there are a lot of companies developing software for the information highway just as there were a lot of companies involved in operating systems at the beginning of the personal computer business everybody who is doing multimedia software will have lots of pilots based on the quality of those pilots some will emerge stronger than others mr gates said microsoft would begin testing home multimedia services in the us and europe in 1995 he did not expect substantial returns on his investment for five years although he thought that there would be substantive developments in multimedia in 1996 97 with entire cities converted to interactive networks multimedia and the information superhighway the high capacity network which will link vast repositories of information with modified television sets or personal computers are creating intense interest among computer companies telecommunications organisations and entertainment firms they are jockeying to take advantage of what are expected to be lucrative new business opportunities bill gates however argues that most are taking the wrong approach dead ends were how he described them because the user interface is so simple and because they do not tie in to personal computers in the right way the results will be disappointing the revenue and the usage that comes out of them will not justify the huge infrastructure costs most of the trials to date have been designed to exploit domestic multimedia offering typically menus of video films for home viewing mr gates says that business will make use of the multimedia first the first widespread use of these capabilities will be in business he predicted it will involve things like video conferencing and collaboration which would enable you to do your job without going into the office or it could help companies find expertise to help them out without the expert having to travel the network itself could create electronic markets able to find a resource of any type so what in the past we have seen as electronic markets for currencies or stocks will move into items of all types where chequeing references and other kinds of working together can be done very effectively in electronic form this will be done by extending the range of the personal computer one of the early symptoms will be very low cost video conferencing where a pc is connected up to an isdn integrated services digital network within two or three years this will be extremely widespread intel which makes the microprocessors used in the majority of the world s personal computers earlier this year announced a low cost set of components capable of turning a personal computer into a video conferencing terminal mr gates thought that multimedia in the office would be evolutionary rather than revolutionary driven by proven technologies like electronic mail the benefits of electronic mail are unbelievable we could not run microsoft without that capability today some think of electronic mail and work group software and the internet an open publicly available computer network spanning several continents as separate things but with some enhancements to windows due in less than a year we will bring all these things together once the technology and benefits have been established in a business environment that would be the time to move into the home mr gates was critical of the narrow range of many of the current multimedia trials some of the early pilots will be particularly embarrassing because they will not have the breadth of applications he said the network operators running these pilots are acting against their own interests because they are going to prove exactly what they do not want to prove that there will not be enough revenue generated to justify building the infrastructure until you have a broad range of applications you will never be able to demonstrate the true potential of these systems that is why instead of doing crummy pilots in 1994 we will start our trials in 1995 he extended his criticism to oracle the us database specialist with which british telecommunications has formed an alliance to test interactive entertainment services in the home oracle will provide the software and systems integration i m sure oracle will change its approach because it is a terrible approach he said bill gates comments have to be seen against a background of intense competition in the nascent multimedia business furthermore he has never been slow to promote microsoft s efforts and pick holes in the competition\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3332", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 survey of information and communications technology 5 computers which

sale pos devices these can be used not only to promote products but also to collect information about customer preferences many pos devices developed so far are linked into isdn so that they can relay customer orders back to head office or be updated with the latest product and price information examples include an interactive point of sales terminal which ford plans to use in its car showrooms to enable customers to see the car of their choice in the colour and configuration they want for example four doors spoilers a system which helps a customer to choose a hairstyle from a database of 4 000

circus london allows customers to sample albums which are to be released in the next few months by selecting a track and a seeing a video clip of the singer customers can operate the terminal using touch screen commands and indicate which releases they are interested in buying aim says that developing a multimedia pos system can take as little as three to four months or up to a year and a half costs of developing a system range from pounds 15 000 to pounds 200 000 multimedia at the point of sale has a lot to offer however 24 multimedia pos kiosks based in london s heathrow airport

john herbert partnership which was involved in the interior design of terminal 4 use at t s multimedia technology at first people spotted the kiosks and wondered what they were for most people did not know so they did not use them now the kiosks have been clearly labelled tax free shopping and at t says usage has increased they allow travellers to use a touch sensitive screen to order goods via credit card the terminal works out how much the goods will cost based on factors such as which currency is being used in payment delivery charge and whether any duty is payable the goods thus ordered can be delivered to any destination in the world within seven working days the tale of the 24 kiosks shows that a multimedia screen has only limited powers of attraction in order to reach a wider

information technology consultancy the installed base of pc networks has now reached the critical mass necessary to provide the incentive for the adoption of groupware elimination of barriers what has changed over the past few months is the speed at which these esoteric technologies are becoming realities last month for example 400 senior telecommunications executives from companies including at t bt mci and mercury packed a seminar in the us to hear claims that business and society would be transformed by multimedia through the elimination of barriers of time space and form opening the conference mr rudy puryear managing partner strategic change at andersen consulting warned that every business assumption would be repeatedly challenged in the next few years the mean time between surprises is shortening he said most of the corporations present were already investigating the potential of multimedia most had only developed a serious interest in the topic in the past year to a large extent their enthusiasm is being driven by commercial demands rather than customer need telecommunications companies like at t mci bt and mercury need to generate better margins from their networks by moving from pots to pans plain old telephone services to pretty awesome new stuff computer companies need to find new ways to encourage customers to buy more computer power as prices fall to commodity levels among those which have already declared an interest in multimedia are apple computer intel silicon graphics and microsoft as well as the games market leaders sega and nintendo mobile computers and groupware are firmly established in the market place there are however question marks remaining over the potential of multimedia it has not been helped by confusion over what the term implies the essential definition is the transformation of information of all kinds textual graphical still and moving video pictures into computer language bits in which form it can be transmitted down a single communications channel which could be a telephone line or a compact disk to a modified television set or personal computer in the office or home the service is interactive customers can send back instructions and requests through the network what is important is that different bits of information are co mingled in the transmission stream the system is responsible for sorting out which are text which are video and so on dr nicholas negroponti director of the massachusetts institute of technology media laboratory believes that the impact of multimedia on the business and social world is inevitable he points to four trends first the disappearing desk top as executives become peripatetic using mobile computers on the move or while working from home second continuing miniaturisation which will make complex and bulky technologies such as speech recognition for pcs simple and easily transported third increased use of the so called negroponti switch the use of fibre to bring multimedia to the office and home leaving precious broadcast bandwidth for mobile telephony and computing fourth the use of intelligent software agents to roam through electronic libraries gathering information of interest to their owners at t already has systems which make use of this advanced concept four elements are required for the profitable development of multimedia systems powerful computers are needed to store process and keep track of the bits high capacity telecommunications channels are needed to transmit them to office or home there has to be a ready supply of information to feed the system the customer must be willing to pay for the new services all the technological elements for full scale multimedia are pretty well in place the computer power software

"FT941-3334", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 survey of information and communications technology 3 shoot out between powerpc and intel s pentium personal computers the technology battle intensifies", "body": "apple computer s introduction of the first powerpc macintosh personal computers blows the starting whistle on what promises to be one of the toughest technology competitions in the history of the personal computer industry on the powerpc team together with apple will be motorola and international business machines together the three companies have co developed a microprocessor architecture which they aim to establish as a new industry standard for pcs they face the reigning champions of the pc microprocessor market intel and its league of pc manufacturing technology partners led by ibm one of the most curious aspects of this contest is that ibm is playing on both sides long a close ally of intel ibm is the largest manufacturer of intel microprocessor based pcs and says it intends to remain so however the computer company is also a co developer and manufacturer of powerpc and has stated that the new technology is central to its future strategy this ambiguity aside the contest is a straight forward shoot out between powerpc and intel s pentium the latest version of its long established x86 microprocessor lineage powerpc has a reduced instruction set computing risc architecture theoretically this suggests that it may be faster than intel s pentium however powerpc lacks the critical software base of intel s microprocessors and its performance in commercial systems is relatively unproven in contrast intel s pentium has a huge head start in the marketplace as the successor of the widely used intel 386 and 486 microprocessors the brains of most pcs in use today the intel chips run microsoft s popular ms dos and windows operating system software and the thousands of application programs designed to work with them apple s debut of powerpc based macintosh computers will be a critical test of the new technology apple is expected to launch three powermac computers ranging in price from about dollars 2 400 to about dollars 4 000 to replace its current quadra models aimed at business users apple says that it intends to convert 40 per cent of its macintosh shipments to powerpc by year s end with the complete changeover occurring within three to four years for apple the powerpc represents an important transition from motorola s 68000 line of microprocessors which it has used since the introduction of the macintosh computer 12 years ago apple needed a new microprocessor to keep pace with competitors using intel s chips but its decision to join with ibm and motorola in developing a brand new architecture makes the transition more risky powerpc s may have a speed advantage over pentium however among existing apple customers the powermac may be judged as much for its compatibility with existing macintosh software as for its raw performance this could give the powerpc a rough start in the personal computer market according to industry reports about 90 per cent of existing macintosh software will run on the new apple computers but only via emulation software which will significantly slow down performance thus although powerpc may be theoretically capable of outpacing the intel pentium that may not be the practical experience of the first users of personal computers based on the new microprocessor apple says that about 75 application programs designed specifically for the powermac will be available when the computers are introduced and that hundreds more are in development however software companies are unlikely to make development of applications programs for the powermac a high priority apple says that it expects to sell up to one million powermac computers in the first 12 months while this would be a significant achievement for apple it presents a relatively limited market for software designed solely for the powermac in contrast intel expects about 15 per cent of all pcs sold this year or approximately seven million units to be based on its pentium chips most of the remaining 40m pcs will contain intel 486 microprocessors thus intel based pcs represent a far larger potential market for software applications than the powermac therefore even if the powermac exceeds apple s expectations it will hardly make a dent in intel s dominance of the personal computer microprocessor market intel and its backers meanwhile are targeting apple s existing market share aiming to take advantage of the uncertainties created by the transition to powerpc apple however is not alone in its plans to offer powerpc based personal computers ibm already offers a computer workstation based on the powerpc microprocessor the company is expected to introduce a broad range of power machines for more general use including portable pcs but it is not yet clear how ibm will position these products relative to its strong intel based pc product line ibm is also actively seeking powerpc endorsements from other computer makers the first canon of japan said recently that it will use powerpc in a new range of office computers and work with ibm and motorola to develop versions of powerpc for use in hand held and notebook sized computers in taiwan powerpc has attracted great interest among pc circuit board manufacturers however these sub system manufacturers are unlikely to take a leadership role in developing the powerpc market instead they tend to wait for demand to develop in the us market reference specifications to pc manufacturers and software developers interested in developing products around the new technology computers that adhere to these specifications will eventually be able to run a smorgasbord of operating systems and applications software ibm says microsoft has announced plans to port windows nt to the powerpc and ibm s new workplace os will run dos windows and os 2 applications on the powerpc poweropen another multipersonality operating environment is being developed specifically for powerpc systems by apple and ibm together ibm and apple aim to establish a 30 percent share of the pc market for powerpc by the end of the decade leaving intel with perhaps 60 per cent the rest being clones of intel microprocessors down from about 80 percent today thus while powerpc may somewhat diminish intel s market share not even its most optimistic backers expect to overtake intel s leadership in the microprocessor market in the short term in the longer term the outcome of the powerpc versus intel battle is likely to depend as much on software developers as on the relative merits of each type of microprocessor\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3335", "title": "ft 16 mar 94

attractive with some exceptions banks will deduct the tax from the accounts of individuals or companies whenever they order a debit to their accounts including issuing cheques or making an electronic

investors and would have an even greater effect on foreigners ms norys aguirre president of the stock exchange the bolsa de valores de caracas has asked the government to exclude exchange transactions from the proposed levy she warned that investors especially from overseas would be driven away noting that the tax would have theoretically added more than dollars 54m to last year s transaction costs brokers and investors are also worried that stock deals will simply move offshore in an effort to avoid the tax ms aguirre pointed out that a similar tax in argentina was eliminated soon after it was applied when the authorities realised that much of that stock exchange s activities had moved to uruguay many argentinians also decided to carry out their daily business activities in cash rather than cheques the government has tried to soften the impact of the debit tax by noting that it will only be in effect until december 31 and that originally a tax of 2 per cent had been discussed the new tax

the ultimate in environmentally friendly paper are especially evident in north america where the vast majority of producers is strongly resisting pressures to move towards the elimination of chlorine from pulp making processes mr matthew van hook vice president of the american forest and paper association s pulp group told the afpa s annual meeting last week that the jury is still out on the environmental impacts of totally chlorine free tcf processes themselves not to mention their technological and economic feasibility chlorine owes its popularity as a bleaching agent to its ability to remove unwanted resins and fatty acids from wood pulp while leaving intact the cellulose fibres required for paper making but chlorine is also a heavy polluter adding toxic by products such as dioxins and chlorinated organic compounds known as aoxs to pulp mill effluent it has increasingly been supplanted as a bleaching agent by hydrogen peroxide supplemented in some cases by an ozone bleaching

in exports to the us mr rogerio braga president of cambuhy citrus one of brazil s largest orange processing companies believes that the country s share of the us market is likely to fall to between 5 and 10 per cent by the end of the 1990s partly as a result of the recently agreed north american free trade agreement this compares with the heyday of brazilian exports to the us in the 1970s when 60 per cent of brazil s total production of frozen concentrated orange juice was sold in north america florida and mexico which has been granted special tariff conditions under nafta will certainly be able to supply almost all of north america s demand he told an international fruit conference last week in rotterdam speakers at the conference which was organised by the port of rotterdam and rabobank the dutch bank that specialises in agri business said that the world s fruit sector also faced challenges caused by changes in the way fruit and fruit juices were marketed increasingly fruit growers and food retailers were attempting to eliminate middlemen such as brokers import agents packers and wholesalers mr braga said the decline in orange juice sales to the north american market over the past few decades was probably irreversible meaning that brazil would have to concentrate on europe already its biggest market and on new markets in asia such as korea in spite of sharp increases in exports to europe there was room for further growth he said because consumption of fruit juice was barely half the us figure of 29 litres a person a year in some countries such as france italy and spain consumption is still in single digits consumption in asia is low in absolute terms but rising rapidly it took us 15 years to see europeans consuming orange juice at half the levels of americans mr braga said we might be able to get south east asia to that level in half that time besides shifts in trade flows brazil and other fruit producers are grappling with the shake up in traditional relations between food retailers and food suppliers the rise of discount chains and own label products in established supermarkets has affected every link of the chain from growers to packers retailers are cutting their fat and have put tremendous pressure on the food processing industry mr braga explained at the netherlands largest supermarket chain albert heijn the trend was towards concluding partnerships directly with growers of fruits and vegetables said mr krijn dorsman executive vice president of merchandising there are too many links in the chain between supplier and consumer he said noting that every link pushes up the retail price of food the dutch supermarket group has therefore moved towards a policy of working with one exclusive partner for every product

or the complete abolition of price support this is believed to be the central message of a detailed strategy document to be considered today by the council of the national farmers union of england and wales the nfu s long term strategy group which produced the report believes the recent gatt deal will lead to another shake up of the common agricultural policy before 2000 current cap policies are not going to increase consumption or bring down the production of cereals and beef sufficiently to allow the eu to meet its obligations under the gatt settlement it says eu farmers are approaching a fundamental policy choice this runs counter to assurances from the european commission and the uk government that no further fundamental change will be needed in sectors subject to current cap reforms to comply with eu commitments under the gatt deal the report is understood to rule out the option of exit bonds under which current agricultural support systems would end overnight and farmers would be compensated with a fixed finite payment which would be tradeable the strategy group says this could push up the eu s annual spending on agriculture currently ecu29bn by 60 70 per cent in the short term and would be politically unacceptable because it would lead to high rural unemployment it also dismisses the extension of output quotas such as those on milk to new sectors saying this would be complicated to administer and would conflict with the general reduction in government intervention in industry the choice therefore would be between tighter controls on inputs for example by increasing the amount of set aside land or reducing the amount of nitrogen used or abolishing the link between support payments to farmers and their production levels farm incomes would be better protected under a system of input controls assuming these would continue to be accompanied by subsidised exports and import tariffs but they may not be sustainable beyond the 1990s if future gatt rounds force lower levels of border protection and export subsidies says the report the decoupling option would expose eu farmers to competition with world prices putting the full burden of support payments on the taxpayer the report suggests eu cereal prices could fall by a further 30 per cent before reaching world price levels and that this might entail an unacceptably high level of

ge yesterday in an apparent move to put pressure on kemper s board to accept the deal it could also be designed to force a decision before any rival suitor has a chance to make a move the market has been rife with rumours of an approach for kemper since the dreyfus deal banco santander the spanish bank which took a 3 per cent stake in kemper in the late 1980s is one name frequently mentioned although its potential involvement in a rescue bid for domestic rival banesto could give its management more than enough to think about in the months ahead other us domestic banks seeking to emulate mellon are also seen as possible bidders ge s approach has caught kemper s management in an unenviable position the company is only just emerging from a period overshadowed by problem real estate investments last year kemper sold off its reinsurance operations and earlier this year completed its exit from the property casualty business in the view of several analysts it could be on the verge of a rebound in earnings although its stock price before ge s approach became public seemed not to reflect this at around dollars 40 the shares earlier this week were trading on a multiple of around 12 to 13 times most analysts expectations of earnings this year considerably lower than other companies in the sector mr michael blumstein of morgan stanley estimates earnings this year of dollars 3 75 a share rising to dollars 4 40 in 1995 a view echoed in a recent research note from allen nadler at merrill lynch ironically it was the disposal of the reinsurance business which first left kemper vulnerable to a bid the sale involved the cancellation of most of the 38 per cent stake in kemper owned by the lumbermen s mutual casualty company wiping out a potentially supportive holding it is not surprising that kemper s management team having dealt with the problems of the early 1990s have not welcomed ge s bid they hate the fact that someone else will come in and take the credit for their efforts said one person close to the company kemper s business now comprises three parts a mutual fund business with dollars 44bn under management a life assurance operation specialising in annuity business and a regional securities brokerage the company abandoned efforts to sell its underperforming securities arm last year after it failed to attract a high enough bid for ge capital a kemper acquisition would provide a springboard into the fastest growing areas of the us retail investment business mutual funds and variable annuities kemper has dollars 70bn in all under management which together with ge s dollars 75bn would create one of the us s biggest fund management groups in a clear attempt to win the backing of kemper s management mr welch in his letter dangled the carrot of a consolidation of all the asset management activities under the kemper umbrella run by its existing managers although under the wing of ge capital the all cash bid of dollars 55 a share values the group s outstanding ordinary shares at dollars 1 8bn and would be worth dollars 2 2bn after taking into account convertible preferred stock and stock options while leaning heavily on kemper s board before it meets this thursday ge seems unwilling at this stage to launch an all out contested bid such an attack would be extremely rare in the financial services business an unwanted deal would run the risk of driving away kemper s best people it would also have to win the backing of state insurance regulators in addition mutual fund groups have a powerful poison pill at their disposal the boards of each fund run by the group could vote to have their assets managed by another company if that were to happen a contested ge takeover would become a hollow victory us mutual fund groups

peter bonfield icl chairman and chief executive mr koshiro kit kitazato fujitsu s man in icl s headquarters in putney west london is charged with co ordination between the japanese computer giant and its uk based subsidiary he says icl has learnt reliability from fujitsu while fujitsu has learnt flexibility from icl fujitsu set several strategic objectives at the time of the takeover icl would be autonomous operating at arm s length from its parent it would retain its european base seek maximum commercial co operation with fujitsu and eventually float on the london stock exchange the first few conditions have been fulfilled the recession has delayed the flotation both companies agree they should work more closely together to share research and development and marketing costs there have been some positive developments icl s new mid range computers are the first to be sold under the two companies names a pioneering trainee exchange scheme is under way the two groups are collaborating on check out systems for supermarkets icl s office software has been rewritten to be marketed in japan despite these achievements icl s 1993 results scheduled for release today will not be exciting turnover will be higher than last year s pounds 2 5bn but pre tax profits are expected to be well below the pounds 38 6m recorded for 1992 profitability has been on the slide since 1989 when icl made pounds 148 6m before tax the 1993 figure represents little more than break even though it is respectable in an industry undergoing global restructuring icl s top management is taking steps to safeguard the group s profitability earlier this year the company raised pounds 100m through a rights issue wholly taken up by fujitsu the first time the uk company had turned to its parent for funds the issue reflects the group s pessimism over short term prospects in the computer marketplace as the industry moves towards low cost low margin operating systems based on common standards cash is one bulwark against a highly competitive market an increasingly efficient and lean operation is another mr bonfield points to the steady decline in the group s overheads in 1987 operating expenses as a percentage of turnover were 26 8 per cent in 1992 the figure was 22 8 per cent and it is expected to have fallen further in 1993 the company employs about 25 000 and is cutting jobs at about 5 per cent a year the reason for icl s drive for economies is the relentless decline in gross profit margin standing at 47 per cent in 1987 it is now less than 35 per cent as the shift to lower cost systems continues nevertheless icl remains the only consistently profitable broad based computer manufacturer headquartered in europe worldwide it is one of the few traditional computer companies not floundering in red ink by comparison siemens nixdorf of germany and olivetti of italy are losing money and groupe bull of france is dependent on repeated restructuring grants from the french government mr bonfield s reputation is high both with fujitsu and the industry at large he was recently asked by mr martin bangemann european union commissioner for industry and telecommunications to join the high level group on information technology set up to consider the impact of information technology on europe this is an indication that icl has restored its euro credentials after being bundled out of high level european policy meetings following the fujitsu takeover but restoring adequate profitability has proved more difficult though it still manufactures mainframe computers more than 50 per cent of icl s revenues come from the services sector competitors now include services companies such as electronic data systems eds and personal computer makers such as compaq as well as its traditional rivals ibm unisys and digital equipment according to input a us consultancy which tracks the computing services business icl s improvement in market share in services ranks it fourth in europe behind the us companies microsoft andersen consulting and eds the company has been split into 26 semi autonomous businesses each with profit and loss responsibilities there are three groups industry systems including countries such as france and portugal under mr richard livesey haworth services including workplace technologies and sorbus europe the maintenance company icl owns with bell atlantic under mr paul whitwam and technology businesses exemplified by design to distribution icl s manufacturing consultancy under mr ninian eadie these changes made over the past year are evidence that the company is going through a second significant restructuring the first took place more than a decade ago when under mr robb wilmot icl forged a technological alliance with fujitsu and pioneered the shift to standard systems that was when icl abandoned cherished notions of setting the technological agenda and accepted that it would have to buy its technology from the best sources despite what many saw as the dead hand of stc icl prospered during the buoyant economy of the late 1980s but both icl and stc were aware the company needed an owner with deeper pockets and greater commitment to the information technology business than stc the solution proved to be fujitsu it bought the company just before the us and western europe entered recession at the same time the cost of computer hardware fell sharply helped by a fierce price war between personal computer manufacturers icl s survival is a consequence of a flexibility uncommon in large companies in storms we are quite quick up the rigging even if the planks are leaking mr livesey haworth says wryly much of this flexibility comes from a trio of acquisitions datachecker a us retail automation company which is the cornerstone of icl s ambitions as a global retail systems company nokia data the finnish personal computer company which icl bought in 1992 and technology the uk s largest personal computer distributor datachecker as icl s senior managers recall was a case study in how not to manage an acquisition the company sent in its own manager and accountants who ran rough shod over local management sensitivities were bruised so the assimilation took longer and cost more than envisaged when icl acquired nokia data it was determined not to make the same mistake pc operations were consolidated in scandinavia the chief impact however was cultural a pattern repeated with the acquisition of technology we needed a shot of the faster moving pc culture mr eadie says so what is icl s future it is likely to remain medium sized it is unlikely to make more money this year than in 1993 as mr bonfield sees no improvement in the market he believes however that icl s reorganisation will be complete this year largely freed from debt through the rights issue and from restructuring charges the company should return to significant profitability in 1995 he predicts this could mean profits eventually reaching 5 to 6 per cent of revenues the worry now is not complacency but battle fatigue we drive this company hard but it s the only way to do it mr bonfield says mr keith todd finance

overhaul of the legislative process with more consultation better drafting and improved scrutiny the case for reform is strong the weight of legislation is growing this year s finance bill at 471 pages is the longest in history yet an increasing amount of time is spent on remedying the defects of recent legislation last year s criminal justice act repealed sentencing reforms introduced in the 1991 act a one clause bill is needed to restore the powers of transport police inadvertently watered down in last year s rail privatisation act a telling indicator of the need for change is the growing number of amendments the government has to table to its own legislation in the lords these have more than doubled during the 1980s according to evidence submitted by lord howe to the hansard society commission on the legislative process which reported last year the late drafting and tabling of amendments inevitably makes parliamentary scrutiny less thorough it also makes it harder for business and other organisations to make an informed contribution towards shaping legislation drafting quality some of the blame for this has been laid at the door of the parliamentary counsel who draft legislation the european policy forum has recently suggested breaking their monopoly to improve the quality of drafting involving outside lawyers in the work would allow departments access to a larger pool of talent contracting out would also force departments to define their objectives clearly and devise reasonable timetables that legal firms could work to however it is not bad drafting which has led to repeated amendments to the police and magistrates courts bill currently passing through the lords it is the failure of the home secretary mr michael howard to convince peers of the wisdom of centralising control over the police service mr john patten education secretary has also had to concede amendments to his education bill to address scepticism over his proposals to curb student unions and to allow schools to control teacher training better drafting could improve the quality of legislation but ministers have much more to contribute ministerial machismo too much legislation is rushed through parliament too hastily in some cases this is to deal with political crises such as a surge in joy riding or a spate of attacks by dangerous dogs but in most cases it is ministerial machismo which sees pushing through radical reforms as the best way to climb the greasy pole frequent ministerial reshuffles encourage this belief since ministers move on before the trouble they have created manifests itself a more serious approach to consultation on contentious changes in the law would help counter such tendencies mr davies says that some departments consult

competitiveness are the world s dominant political themes today in north america and asia the main concern of government and business is how to achieve a strong position in the global economy ideology has been abandoned in favour of a pragmatic search for the quickest surest way to boost competitiveness and growth and to turn the prospect of a new cycle of international economic growth into reality in europe on the other hand the break with the past is not so clear cut political attention seems to focus on the past rather than the future on defence rather than attack on rejuvenating the old rather than creating the new the result is yet another year of missed business opportunities for europe and rising unemployment to socially unacceptable levels this contradiction is even more evident in italy here political debate has either failed to take account of the future now emerging or it is confined to impromptu demagogic assertions that ignore the global competition italy should be preparing to meet if it wishes to avoid being excluded from the ranks of industrialised nations now in the run up to an election that will be decisive for the country s future the electoral scene is far from inspiring on march 27 and 28 italians go to the polls under a new electoral system the outcome of a referendum which vetoed the intolerable regime of corruption and inefficiency generated by the lack of alternatives to the dominant political system for months debate centred on how to create an electoral system that would permit alternation between a progressive pole and a conservative pole enabling italy to stand alongside the great western democracies but partly because the new electoral law was the reluctant product of a parliament forced to act by the result of the referendum the elections will take place in a climate dominated by three main factors first the reality of transformation to a great extent these elections are in the hands of the offspring of the old political system of whom the most brazen representative is the standard bearer of forza italia together with the embalmed remains of certain areas of the left second the risk to economic self sufficiency a real risk which lies beneath the wonder cures promised by the right or the sermons of the outdated apologists of the left third confusion the contest is riddled with left over ideologies which have been disinterred for the occasion such suicidal behaviour may not be surprising coming from the new right but it is alarming when it appears among the more serious elements of the centre and the left what politicians should be doing is explaining to the electorate that italy is not the centre of the world or even of europe and that if we want to remain at the forefront of world markets we have to identify our competitive advantages and abandon rearguard actions and verbal wars behind all the manoeuvrings of the politicians old and new in this vital election there is a country which has decided to move on this is the real italy the country has grown you need look no further than today s great moral clean up which in its pursuit of a whole generation of corrupt politicians has reached a scale unparalleled in any other country or the spirit of sacrifice displayed by countless citizens in the face of an often chaotic punitive fiscal system and an inefficient oppressive public sector or the vigour and innovative capacity of an entrepreneurial class that has reasserted its competitiveness despite the constraints under which it operates the remarkable improvement in the trade balance in 1993 from l4 000bn to l50 000bn was not due entirely to devaluation this italy must be represented politically by dignified action and thought the growing interest in its financial markets demonstrates that italy s international image is changing and foreign observers view of the new italy is far more accurate than the picture created by the election campaign italy cannot afford to forego the chance to take part in a new cycle of growth in an ever more interconnected world this will require rational decisions calculated sacrifices and an acceptable balance between recovery and growth it means social consensus and a government capable of plotting an intelligent pragmatic and credible course there is no room here for slogans and miracle makers in today s world non alignment

could do was register agreement on the importance of the topic and indicate the nature of the emerging consensus on what to do about it this the summit has done in breaking new ground for the discussions among the group of seven industrial countries it may even have given that intellectually moribund body new life not that the g7 s familiar macroeconomic disharmony was entirely absent one of the recurring leitmotifs of its two decades has been the us effort to persuade the germans to adopt more expansionary policies the jobs summit was partly an imaginative new way to achieve that old objective the pitch adopted by us labour secretary robert reich was that cyclical unemployment which persists may turn into structural or classical types of unemployment which are more difficult to address the argument is correct but it cuts two ways rising inflation must also be avoided because it leads to recession as surely as night follows day it is not clear that the clinton administration understands this point if a transatlantic consensus on macroeconomic policy is lacking the agreement elsewhere was encouraging the summit has for example rejected protection against imports and embraced innovation rightly so in both cases labour intensive imports and new technology will make industrial countries richer but as mr reich observes they also exact a price the primary structural labour market problem he notes is a shift in relative labour demand against less educated workers and those doing routine tasks and towards workers with problem solving skills increased inequality in the us the result has been increased inequality with workers in the higher earnings bracket enjoying a 4 4 per cent increase in real wages over the past 20 years while those on the bottom suffered a 10 3 per cent real decline because there was no overall real wage growth us employment also grew by some 40 per cent in continental europe by contrast average real wages grew rapidly over the past two decades by 76 per cent in france and 43 per cent in germany there was also very little increase in pay inequality but these countries enjoyed virtually no employment growth while unemployment rose cycle by cycle the question then is not whether jobs can be created it is obvious that they can be the question is whether those new jobs can be combined with sustained rises in average real wages and the pay equality to which europeans in particular are attached the challenge is not just more jobs it is good jobs for everyone holy grail secretary reich s own suggested solution is the trio of european style education and training us style labour market flexibility and expansionary macroeconomic policy so is this the holy grail for jobs only up to a point mr reich yes education and training matter but high quality basic education matters most a policy that may never work for all and certainly will not act quickly yes labour market flexibility is essential but this is a euphemism for policies that will lower the relative and quite possibly the absolute real wage of the unskilled precisely what europeans and increasingly americans find objectionable and yes macroeconomic policy must accommodate growth but even padraig flynn european commissioner for employment agrees that there is a new conventional wisdom that cyclical recovery will not be the way out there is room for a great deal of imaginative new thinking of the kind contained in a new pamphlet from the london based think tank demos on the end of unemployment but at the heart of that thinking must be ways to lower the cost of hiring new employees if at the same time rewards are to be sustained large employment subsidies for the unskilled will be required instead of the taxes often imposed upon them but that would necessitate higher taxes elsewhere combined with subsidies for training and radical labour market deregulation this is the only policy likely to put industrial countries on the path they are apparently seeking\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3451", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 letters to the editor why wales resists change", "body": "sir i read with interest philip stephens article pm urged to shelve

party and presumably they hope to appease them with a vigorous stand in defence of national sovereignty but the problem is that this is a crusade which is certain to fail in the medium term and probably in the short term as well in any case why go out on a limb now the maastricht treaty was such a miserable experience for mr john major that you would think the prime minister would do his best to steer clear of all questions of principle about europe and its development for as long as possible yet here he is taking a combative stand on an issue which is bound to involve a battle on two fronts it must lead to an unwinnable confrontation with his partners in europe but it must also stir up the anti european campaigners among those who are nominally his own supporters this is a spectacular exercise in political masochism this crusade is doomed to defeat because its underlying objectives set the uk at odds with virtually all its european partners the government pretends that it is only asking that the voting rules which protect blocking minorities in the council of ministers should be kept at the present level even after the admission of four more member states 23 votes or the equivalent of two big countries and one small the reality of course is that the british government is trying to make majority voting more difficult than at present whereas effective decision making in a larger union will obviously require more majority voting not less the puzzle is that the conservative government seems to have been manoeuvred by its euro phobic wing into refighting the last war but one the windmill it is tilting at is the old fantasy that britain s national sovereignty is threatened by the sinister federalists in brussels and it appears to imagine that it can creep by stealth back in the direction of a national veto it does not seem to realise that the terms of the debate have been changed beyond recognition many years ago in 1965 66 the community had a shattering confrontation between france and the rest over the rights and wrongs of majority voting that was before majority voting was due to come into force as part of the community s normal regime and the french were trying to prevent it happening after a six month confrontation a truce was signed in 1966 which was afterwards called the luxembourg compromise even though there had been no compromise on anything nevertheless the psychological shock of the crisis effectively deterred majority voting for 20 years but the luxembourg compromise was wiped off the slate by the 1986 single european act which explicitly broadened the scope for majority voting and the agenda on the slate was rewritten by the maastricht treaty which also carried the majority voting trend even further as a result today s central question about majority voting is the reverse of yesterday s it is not whether a member state can be compelled by majority vote to do things it would rather not do but whether it can use its national veto to prevent most or all of its partners from doing what they collectively want to do it is now clear that the first old fashioned question can have several different answers most rational people now recognise that the purpose of majority voting is not to out vote the recalcitrant but to persuade them to negotiate and to compromise but for those who will not negotiate and will not submit there is the alternative of the opt out if you don t like the journey you can leave the ship that was the double lesson of maastricht the other member states could not compel the uk to accept the social chapter or the danes to accept monetary union or indeed anything else in the treaty but nor in the last resort could britain and denmark prevent the others from going ahead with the treaty they had compromised on in the long run the majority will get the kind of europe they want and the options for those who disagree will essentially be quite simple to compromise to submit or to stand aside if majority decisions are blocked inside the council of ministers through systematic legal obstruction they will be taken outside in some other way if the british government is now trying to strengthen the legal methods of obstruction it is perhaps because it is slowly dawning that the opt out is not a satisfactory type of solution the plan for economic and monetary union may well prove an acute test case and it is likely to come to a head during the 1996 inter governmental conference to review and revise the maastricht treaty at that moment it will be clear which member states are still committed to monetary union and it is quite possible that an inner core will be ready to go ahead to a single currency conceivably in a very near future mr major will then be left holding his opt out which means he cannot stop them just as it means he cannot join them note that the concept blocking minority does not exist in any european treaties what they lay down is the number of positive votes required to pass a measure at present 54 out of 76 the underlying assumption is that the governments which signed the treaties share a broad political consensus on the purpose of their association that consensus did not exist in 1965 but the french lost that battle for one simple reason they could not impose their view of europe then and it is time the british saw that they cannot impose their view of europe now\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3458", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 essential or just extra baggage is bigger better in the global business travel industry", "body":

24 hours notice a computerised record of where employees have travelled recently and whether they got the best deal available if they have not he asks them why wagonlit which is part of accor the

dollars 10 8bn operating from 4 000 locations in 125 countries two main competitors american express and thomas cook each operate from about 2 000 locations either their own offices or those of client companies the two sides in the partnership said the new company carlson wagonlit travel aimed to service the growing needs of the global business traveller to market the new brand worldwide develop new global business travel technology and pursue immediate expansion into new business markets throughout the world in particular the asian and pacific regions mr curt carlson the founder of the carlson empire says the combined travel company will be able to improve services to clients such as general electric which places its dollars 350m a year travel business with carlson in phoenix arizona mr carlson whose company s other interests include radisson hotels and tgi friday s restaurants which are not part of the merged venture says big companies often have difficulty with their travel operating in new countries where agencies often just speak the local language and airlines use different ticket codes carlson will contribute its strengths in the us to wagonlit s strong position in europe the newly merged company will invest an initial dollars 40m in setting up or buying agencies in asia the pacific region latin america and africa where it is under represented why did they choose each other mr herve gourio president of wagonlit travel says carlson is the best partner for us because we are about the same size in the travel business and at the group level neither is predominant european or american mr travis tanner president of carlson travel promises a real working union to create the number one in business travel not a paper partnership nor a smoke and

doubt on the prospects of merging two organisations with such different cultures this is not a marriage made in heaven said one rival business travel executive i can t see the americans being run by the french or vice versa the new company will have two chairmen one from carlson and one from wagonlit and two chief executives also one from each side although the company headquarters will be in london the two sides said daily operations will be co ordinated from minneapolis and paris respectively carlson one of the largest privately owned groups in the us is seen in the travel industry as run with a firm hand from its minneapolis headquarters wagonlit which has gone through a series of changes and acquisitions is regarded as still formulating its culture accor acquired wagonlit which had taken over the uk business travel interests of pickfords in 1992 the company was then called wagons lits but changed its name to wagonlit last year to distinguish itself from accor s railway services division which still uses the old name the planned new company brings together some of the oldest names in the travel business carlson s travel business began as the ask mr foster travel agency in st augustine florida in 1888 making it the oldest travel agency in the us its name came from a local resident mr foster who was the unofficial keeper of train timetables carlson acquired ask mr foster in 1979 wagonlit was founded in 1872 to provide sleeping cars for overnight travellers on european trains in 1928 it set up travel agencies in rail ticket offices throughout europe for over 60 years wagonlit had an alliance with thomas cook the thinking behind the tie was that thomas cook s strength in the old british empire would complement wagonlit s power in continental europe the link was dissolved in 1989 in a pointed statement yesterday mr christopher rodrigues thomas cook s chief executive said since we decided to sever our relationship with wagonlit we have been building the thomas cook network by working with like minded partners who put customer service first forming alliances is only the beginning of the relationship and major industry players such as ourselves will be watching the progress of this alliance with interest however it will be customers who will judge its real value not all wagonlit s customers see merit in the merger or in the idea that companies need a single business to handle their travel requirements worldwide mr lamb says foseco does not even have the same travel agents as burmah castrol its parent company which uses thomas cook foseco was already using wagonlit when it was acquired by burmah castrol in 1990 although the company asks different agencies to bid for its travel account every two or three years it has seen no need to abandon wagonlit which has two staff members based at foseco s premises mr lamb says that foseco and burmah castrol did decide jointly to seek discounts from airlines as their larger combined purchasing power enabled them to get a better deal they have investigated using a single travel agency throughout the group but decided there were no similar savings to be made the larger combined purchasing power would not have yielded bigger discounts mr lamb believes there are advantages to having two travel agencies working for different parts of his group he says we believe it keeps both of them on their toes mr lamb is sceptical of the claim that combining wagonlit with carlson will enable the combined group to deliver a more competitive service he says my answer to that is if getting much bigger means you can purchase so much more efficiently kindly tell us how much that s going to benefit us in discounts the proposed merger does have its champions however mr andrew solum travel manager of inmarsat the international satellite organisation which is also a wagonlit customer says it should bring significant benefits after taking on wagonlit last year to handle travel arrangements from its london headquarters mr solum was sufficiently impressed to ask them to do the same for inmarsat s offices in princeton new jersey six weeks ago the organisation opened an office in beijing where wagonlit is not represented mr solum hopes the planned merger will enable carlson wagonlit travel to open an office there he says the idea of a global travel agency network is more than mere hype if his organisation s employees are bumped off flights in different parts of the world he says a call from wagonlit to the airline often gets them back on the aircraft the wider a travel agency network s reach the more places there are where it can perform such services he says wherever you are in the world if you ve got a wagonlit ticket you can go into a local office if you

meaning in the play that fiona shaw and deborah warner have not thought about though they choose to ignore a few of beckett s precise instructions he required that may s feet be heard but not seen and that she have grey hair and a gray wrap shaw s stockinged legs and sandalled feet can be seen likewise her dark hair and red dress shaw s obsessive intensity her wit her ability to alternate voices her irishness all pay dividends and so does engel s ponderous cultivated contralto warner s most daring stroke is to have shaw spend most of the play not onstage but on a special platform in the centre of the dress circle and to have engel s voice emerge from beneath her so that shaw in the very centre of the audience seems to pace upon her mother s tomb but must shaw and warner reveal their talent in so self advertising a manner shaw s withered old maid posture is too obviously contrived her sexually frustrated fiddlings at the folds of dress before her crotch are over emphatic and her little girl petrified virgin voice makes the whole affair artificial in some ways footfalls seem to encapsulate all those other shaw warner collaborations that london has seen in recent years electra the good person of sichuan hedda gabler i do not mean that as much of a compliment thanks largely to warner shaw has developed in recent years a dreadfully solipsistic way of acting as if there were no one else onstage thanks also to warner she has become our most emphatic exponent of female neurosis and or victimisation and or masochism true footfalls is a far more appropriate vehicle for all this than those other plays but those of us who have been through the other shaw warner collaborations may well feel that this is just more of the same at the garrick theatre until april 19 presented

era are fair game these days for conductors from the period instrument movement twenty years ago bach and handel were still being played by symphony orchestras 10 years ago people argued that authentic haydn and mozart would never catch on each decade the authentic brigade moves on to its next hunting ground norrington and gardiner have already tackled berlioz and brahms both making a particularly good job of the latter s german requiem now nikolaus harnoncourt known in his earlier days for his monteverdi operas and bach cantatas has caught up with them the enormous success of his beethoven symphony cycle made further progress into the 19th century inevitable there is one big difference with harnoncourt when he conducts classical or romantic music he prefers to work with conventional orchestras although he does his level best to turn them into honorary period musicians the admirable young players of the chamber orchestra of europe look wholehearted converts the double bass players play standing up the timpanist sits on a low chair and the violins renounce their usual vibrato in harnoncourt s hands they become a lithe red blooded orchestral animal with lean strings and snarling brass ready to pounce at their conductor s next command there is a high quota of aggression in harnoncourt s conducting and it made itself felt from the beginning of friday s barbican concert with a trenchant performance of beethoven s coriolan overture there was no soloist which may account for a disappointing audience though a noisily appreciative one the central work was schumann s fourth symphony so different in style from leppard s recent schumann cycle that regular barbican concert goers might have wondered if they were listening to the same composer where leppard was fluent and graceful harnoncourt dug into the music with zealous determination this is a conductor who always likes to spring a surprise in brahms s first symphony he did not drive relentlessly along as one might have expected but found time for relaxation as well if the music still sounded stark one suspects that for harnoncourt overturning a century s tradition of glowing romantic performances is half the delight as he raced triumphantly through the final brass chorale the adrenalin count hit danger level other brahms conductors beware education work in the community has become a prime responsibility of britain s orchestras but it costs money on monday the london symphony orchestra held a gala concert in aid of the lso endowment fund to raise support for its education programme and invited jessye norman as the star attraction a useful insurance policy if the ticket prices are going to be that high a solo recital on the south bank earlier this year proved that jessye norman can fill a hall alone at prices most orchestras in this country would long to charge for large scale symphony concerts as that occasion showed she has been adventurous in learning new music while the spontaneity has been going out of the old perhaps a singer needs constant renewal as an artist to keep up the momentum for this concert she was joined by colin davis lso principal conductor elect and a long time colleague they share a record company they had put together a programme equally shared between two composers tempting speculation that each of them would excel in one half britten for him strauss for her of course it never works out that simply britten s late cantata phaedra was written for a mezzo janet baker and has usually been sung by mezzos but it falls very comfortably for jessye norman s low ish soprano alone of the singers i have heard in it she experienced no strain at the top the very fullness of the voice adds another side to the character in some of her singing of late the extrovert outward signs of involvement have concealed a deadness at the core but not here phaedra s inner torment and shame were fully alive the beating heart of a rounded portrayal there was no lack of heart in her strauss the closing scene from capriccio in fact the sheer generosity of the voice and the personality was too much of a good thing there is a cool elegant poise written into the music of strauss s countess which is smothered if the vocal line bulges with heated emotion and verbal emphasis true strauss stylists like janowitz take a more refined line nevertheless jessye norman was in lustrous voice the star appeal still shines brightly in between came two orchestral items which were definitely not fillers it is a luxury to hear the four sea interludes from britten s peter grimes played by a top orchestra and the lso showed what a difference it makes the partnership with davis is promising a splendid future his mature wisdom and their panache combining in a fine performance of strauss s don juan if the lso continues to play as well as this it can be the star in its own gala concert next time lso concert sponsored by american

for salvaging contaminated land is being tested in the us", "body": "a novel approach to one of the us s most common but most intractable environmental problems is being tested by a team of scientists at a us federal uranium processing facility in kentucky the field test has nothing to do with radioactive waste or nuclear safety however the scientists are seeking a process for cleaning up leaked fuel industrial solvents and other substances that have contaminated the soil at thousands of sites in the us the technology raises new hope that many of these areas of land can return to productive use it also promises to speed up the faltering 14 year effort to clean up the worst of the areas one of the things that has hampered progress is a slow pace of technological innovation says bill roberts a toxic waste expert at the environmental defence fund a private lobbying group of the 1 200 to 1 300 sites designated as the most dangerous under the superfund programme set up in 1980 by the us government s environmental protection agency epa to clean up contaminated land about 200 have been reclaimed so far the new technique known as the lasagne process involves using electrical current to draw wastes through treatment zones in the soil toxic waste materials can often be rendered harmless in the zones which resemble the layers of a lasagne without being brought to the surface scientists say the process is effective in densely packed soils that are nearly impossible to reclaim with current techniques it may also prove cheaper and safer as part of a wider initiative announced in january by the epa the project highlights the clinton administration s policy of encouraging co operation between the public and private sectors and among rival companies in the fight against pollution three big us industrial groups monsanto dupont and general electric have taken leading roles in the project together with the epa and the department of energy the common denominator of the primary collaborators was that we each had difficult and expensive soil clean up problems to deal with and were frustrated by the lack of cost effective technology to do the job says philip brodsky director of corporate research and environmental technology at monsanto the big us chemical group the epa s willingness to play a matchmaker role was critical in getting the process rolling soil remediation lends itself to joint research and development there are economies of scale that come into play here roberts says there is no long term return in a company investing in this kind of new technology by itself the effectiveness of the lasagne process has yet to be demonstrated however with testing so far limited to small scale trials the kentucky site where its evaluation begins this spring was chosen because it is typical in an isolated storage area at the facility the solvent trichloro ethylene widely used as a paint stripper has penetrated the dense soil the epa says it will be a couple of years before comparisons of the process s cost and efficacy can be made currently the main approach to dealing with contaminated land is to excavate the toxic material and either incinerate it or seal it in watertight pits however toxic substances leaking from ruptured tanks for example may spread deep below the surface the expense is also prohibitive and the risk of human exposure is great if the contamination is deep but the soil is relatively permeable wastes may have collected in ground water which can be pumped to the surface and neutralised but in soils with impermeable clay layers so called pump and treat methods are ineffective residual contamination usually infiltrates fissures in the hard clay below the ground water and eventually seeps back in the lasagne process may provide a solution in such cases brodsky who initiated the project says various geological conditions are present in most sites and it is impossible to pinpoint which may be suitable for the lasagne treatment but the technology may contribute to an overall solution in a substantial proportion of them brodsky s idea was to combine three existing technologies first a process called electro osmosis flushes the contaminants out of the clay fissures a cathode is inserted into the ground which emits low voltage electrical current that pulls the positive ions in the waste droplets at the rate of about once inch a day second a series of treatment zones the lasagne s layers are carved in the soil the top and bottom strata are filled with an electrical conductor such as graphite waste gathers in the middle layers when the current is switched on the third step deals with the contaminated material once it is there often catalysts are available to help convert hazardous compounds to benign substances once inside the treatment zones alternatively bioremediation systems to degrade the waste organically are being developed by a number of companies including monsanto dupont and ge another option used in the kentucky test is to put activated carbon in the treatment zones to absorb the contaminants the new technology has surfaced at a propitious time last month the epa proposed sweeping revisions of the superfund law following widespread perception that it has failed to achieve many of its goals among its proposals the epa would ease standards for cleaning up some superfund sites in an effort to encourage redevelopment of abandoned land more importantly the new accent on flexibility is likely to spill over into state and federal rules applying to cleaning up the thousands of waste sites not covered by the superfund programme even if the lasagne project fails brodsky believes the joint effort will continue the collaborative paradigm has already proved very productive he says citing advances in bioremediation soil flushing and other areas\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3465", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 business and the environment big boys game comes

germany s most ambitious environmental project a dangerous manipulation which serves the throw away society he has joined the swelling chorus of critics who claim that the waste disposal scheme is misconceived von weizsacker s criticism is directed at the monopolistic structure that characterises dsd and makes the country s recycling industry increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few utilities and energy groups dsd was created in 1991 by 600 companies in response to the packaging law drawn up by klaus topfer the environment minister this makes manufacturers and retailers responsible for collection and recycling of packaging waste it also sets collection and recycling quotas which increase over time and must be enforced nationally industrial groups in germany set up dsd as a national waste collection scheme which signed contracts with waste recyclers to meet the cost of collection dsd imposes a fee borne mostly by consumers through higher prices and shown as a green dot on packaging because the law insisted the system should be nationwide dsd quickly spread to nearly all german cities few german households are without the special yellow bins for packaging waste with green dots three years after its creation dsd s quasi monopoly has angered middle sized german recyclers and environmentalists who say the giant waste collector is squeezing out of a profitable market the small players who represent a pool of innovation for new environmentally friendly recycling technologies the federal cartel office has admitted there is a problem but argues that dsd is only fulfilling the packaging law undaunted the medium sized companies are intensifying their lobbying efforts within government circles they point out that in 1992 more than 140 waste

officials say according to the environmental council an advisory body to the federal states four or five companies are likely to share some 40 per cent of the domestic waste market in coming years dsd

options", "body": "the trouble with the idea and practice of organisational change is that it is both boring and anxiety provoking the number of magazine and newspaper articles courses memos and self help books dealing with change is overwhelming adapt or die change or decay is not a simple rallying cry for the senior manager it is a reality but the question is how to bring about successful change to maximise effectiveness and minimise pain managers choose different strategies with varying consequences the fellowship strategy this approach relies heavily on interpersonal relations using seminars dinners and events to announce and discuss what needs to be changed and how people at all levels are listened to supposedly treated equally and conflicting opinions are expressed this warm and fuzzy approach emphasises personal commitment over ideas the change process may have serious problems getting going as a consequence because this strategy is averse to conflict it can miss crucial issues and even waste time many fellowship types leave the organisation and can only be replaced by those who have a need to belong the political strategy here the power structure is targeted by attempting to influence the official and unofficial leaders the strategy seeks to identify and persuade those in the organisation who are most respected and who have large constituencies political strategists flatter bargain and compromise to achieve their ends but this de stabilises the organisation because of ongoing shifts in people s political stances maintaining credibility can be difficult because the strategy is so obviously devious getting people to show their true colours in this way is never simple the economic strategy the cynical economist believes that money is the best persuader the person who controls the purse strings can buy or change anything everybody has a price this is the rational homo economicus approach that assumes people act more or less logically but that their logic is based on economic motives but buying people off can be costly and the effects short term the strategy also ignores emotional issues and all questions besides bottom line profit the academic strategy this approach assumes that if you present people with enough information and the correct facts they will accept the need to change the academic strategist commissions studies and reports from employees experts and consultants although such strategists are happy to share their findings it is difficult to mobilise energy and resources after the analysis phase analysis paralysis often results because the study phase lasts too long and the results and recommendations are frequently out of date when they are published the engineering strategy this is the technocratic approach that assumes that if the physical nature of a job is changed enough people will be forced to change the strong emphasis on the structural aspects of problems leads to a sensitivity to the environment which is particularly helpful in unstable situations the concern over channels of communication can prompt structural change but fails to commit most people most people do not like being treated as machines and hence do not feel committed such change can also break up happy and efficient teams the strategy is limited because only high level managers can really understand it it is impersonal and it ignores the question what is in this for me the military strategy this approach is reliant on brute force and sometimes ignorance it is at times used by the military and the police students pressure groups and political parties the emphasis is on learning to use the weapons for the fight physical strength and agility are required and following the plan is rewarded but the change enforcer cannot relax in case the imposed change disappears furthermore force is met by force and the result is ever escalating violence the confrontational strategy this high risk strategy reckons that if you can arouse and then mobilise anger in people to confront the problem they will change much depends on the strategists ability to argue the points as well as being able to stir up anger without promoting violence this approach encourages people to confront problems they would prefer not to address but tends to focus too much on the problem and not on the solution anger and conflict tend to polarise people and can cause a backlash few of these strategies occur in isolation but they do have different basic assumptions about who to influence how to proceed and what to focus on each tends to be effective at addressing certain change problems but very bad at dealing with others the political strategy has problems with credibility the economic approach with maintaining change and the academic with implementing findings but for the professional who must demonstrate his worth to the organisation by implementing change any of the above might help him the trouble is that strategies tend to be chosen by chief executives for personal reasons rather than as a result of any well considered set of options an inappropriate strategy may cause more trouble than the initial reason for

to shop around for supplies it expects its pounds 2 3m a year electricity bill for the 31 units in the hydro deal to fall by about pounds 250 000 like mcdonald s stakis was not spoiled for choice bill gunn in charge of utilities purchasing for the group says only the two scottish power distribution companies were prepared to make an offer covering hotels throughout the uk stakis s main requirement was simplicity electricity bills seem to us to be far too complicated with different charges for maximum demand for supply and for different times of the day we wanted a uniform price for each unit of electricity which is the same for all hotels and for that price to include everything we have limited resources and a single price makes billing far easier to double check it is also useful for comparison purposes if one hotel is using far more units than another with similar occupancy rates we will know there is something wrong perhaps they leave everything on in the kitchen overnight both hydro electric and scottish power were able to meet stakis s request for uniform prices but hydro s tender was lower not all companies however have found it easy to shop around at fowler holden john hardy managing director badgered electricity suppliers for several months before he received an offer he considered may be acceptable at first i could not get suppliers to compete he says they seemed only interested in making decent offers to large companies but large companies are my competitors and if they are getting big cuts in their electricity bills i want them too the first six offers made to fowler would have resulted in its power bill remaining at about pounds 26 000 a year it was only this week when one company powerline the midlands electricity subsidiary revised an earlier proposed deal to produce annual savings of about pounds 2 000 the lateness of the proposed offer means fowler will be unable to change supplier until after april 1 since the electricity authorities need 20

need to work at getting a job most people have heard of aspirants firing off scores of applications and of advertisements attracting hundreds of inquiries even for quite lowly posts there is nothing unusual about the committed job seeker but the trend towards more flexible workforces and slimmer companies is influencing individual approaches to employment richard mckeown has gone one step further than chasing every vacancy turning his skills as a chartered secretary into an aggressively marketed business service aimed at short term employment opportunities mckeown 46 who lives in uxbridge west london was made redundant in 1987 after the company he worked for moved to south wales and he decided not to go with it he invested pounds 7 000 with an outplacement agency which did not find him a job but which gave him valuable advice about interviews and how to write a cv since 1988 he has had a series of temporary contracts in the company secretarial role and is now completing a short stint as a temporary assistant company secretary at kingfisher mckeown s name is registered with three recruitment agencies but he has gone beyond being merely a hopeful job applicant he spends pounds 5 000 a year on marketing himself this includes employing a public relations expert he produces a glossy brochure advertising his skills experience previous employers selected references and the work he is capable of doing he is in his own words the all singing all dancing one man band mckeown may be the manager of the future the sort of individual whom management philosopher charles handy writes about in his new book the empty raincoat handy talks about a portfolio approach to life where you decide how much you want to work how you want to work and where you want to work newly restructured organisations he has observed are moving increasingly towards the employment of fee charging professionals a whole new employment industry has sprung up over the past 10 15 years to provide temporary or interim managers many do not see themselves as temporary workers in the long term but are prepared to fulfil such roles until a permanent post comes along mckeown claims to have crossed the rubicon in this respect and now sees himself as a permanent temp he says he does not feel insecure has never been despairing and is relaxed about his prospects his experience as an itinerant employee is growing his former clients include btr lautro and mercury communications the use of temporary staff started in silicon valley in the us among start up companies they employed a core of essential staff on a permanent basis and made up the rest of their workforce with temporary contractors now the strategy is spreading to individual managers mckeown argues that it can be good for professionals because they can command higher fees than they would get on a salaried basis it can be good for the company because it is buying a short term and often essential stop gap at a fixed price the downside for the employer would seem to be cost and to some extent uncertainty about quality although the temporary nature of the employment lessens the potential damage of recruiting a dud jeff grout managing director of robert half which has about 500 temporary accountants on its books says as companies have come out of the recession they are not rushing to recruit staff back on a permanent basis the traditional temp has changed dramatically it used to be in low level grades but there are now some very senior people doing it charles russam managing director of the gms consultancy and secretary of the association of temporary and interim executive services says his company database lists 3 500 executives to supply companies that need senior business managers at director level or one level below he estimates the executive leasing or interim management sector is worth between pounds 70m and pounds 100m in the uk and that it is growing at about 20 per cent a year as it is increasingly viewed as a serious alternative to long term employees he says interim management is no longer being seen as the recycling of clapped out executives but as a credible option for business businesses are saying to themselves why do i need to keep such people on my payroll when i can go into the market and get someone in to do a specific job but how do you avoid getting a useless manager attempting to revive a washed up career russam admits that such people have found their way on to agency books his own company he says will no longer list anyone for whom it does not have three satisfactory references as registered employment agencies such companies take their fees from employers it means that we owe a duty of care to our clients so it is in our interests to ensure that the people we are supplying are of a good calibre says russam interest in temporary managers is growing he says among expanding small businesses which need hands on management help often on a part time basis use of the temporary professional has expanded markedly in the field of information technology about 20 000 to 30 000 freelance employees are working in this area in the uk with about 20 agencies marketing their services

don t do well manufacturers will blame us he says the company has become rigorous with its contractors all conversations with freelances discussing their abilities are recorded afterwards and kept on file it may appear big brotherish but it s not it is really a way of making a quality selection against the requirement the client gives us coombes says contracts tend to be for three months employees do not have the holiday arrangements that their full time colleagues enjoy but the trade off in job security tends to be higher salaries computer operators in the pounds 15 000 to pounds 20 000 salary range may find themselves earning the equivalent of between pounds 20 000 and pounds 28 000 a week for the duration of the contract experienced programmers will be earning the equivalent of pounds 30 000 to pounds 45 000 a year compared with pounds 20 000 to pounds 30 000 in a full time post richard mckeown agrees that the fees commanded by temporary professionals are higher than full time salaries the fee he says has to account for personal overheads self provision of pensions holidays and car he also feels justified in including an additional element to reflect his availability at short notice one of the biggest problems for individuals he argues is adopting the frame of mind that accepts temporary contract working as the norm to do this he believes it is necessary to build up

imposed by some but not all of the leading manufacturers it cited those which limit dealers freedom to advertise outside their territory limit dealers freedom to hold or acquire dealerships from other car makers outside their territory prevent dealers holding or acquiring competing dealerships in their territory restrict the extent to which dealers can sell car related goods or services such as hire second hand car sales fast fit or multi brand servicing outside their territory limit the number of the manufacturer s cars that any dealer or dealer group may sell in any given period or the proportion of the total sales of its cars that may be made by any dealer or dealer group ford and other makers have dug in their heels against the recommendations consumer groups have been consistently critical of manufacturers and dealers claiming that mediocre service and repair performance undermines the concept on which block exemption had been based they also want a market free for

the committee s wish to draw its own conclusions but he believed that responses from individual companies might not necessarily lead to the correct conclusions he expressed the view that the securities and investments board the city s chief watchdog which commissioned the survey should provide the committee with all the details mr field s letter to sir simon came after he had discussed the issue with mr peter thurnham the leader of the conservative mps on the committee the matter is to be raised at the committee s meeting today commons select committees have wide ranging powers to

davis john haltiwanger and scott schuh found that although smaller companies created new jobs at a much faster rate than did larger employers they also destroyed jobs much more quickly companies with fewer than 20 employees added an average of 16 5 per cent to their workforces each year the study showed but they also destroyed an average of 18 8 per cent of their jobs at the same time companies with more than 50 000 employees created new jobs averaging 6 3 per cent of their total workforces each year and destroyed 8 per cent on average in a nutshell net job creation behaviour in the us manufacturing sector exhibits no strong or simple relationship to employer size the study says the census bureau economists also note that newly created jobs at small manufacturing plants are much less likely to survive than new jobs at large plants they complain of fallacious statistical presentations of the data on job creation suggesting that if a company drops in size below the cut off point for small businesses it can seem to increase employment in the small business sector even if it really represents a loss of jobs since large companies account for most of manufacturing

000 arabs who live in hebron burial place of the biblical patriarchs abraham and jacob and an area sacred to both moslem and jew they refuse to see hebron as occupied for them it is an intrinsic part of the land of israel promised to the jews by god part of their cultism is reflected in their deep belief they are being victimised not only by the arabs but by their treacherous jewish government they believe all outsiders do not understand them and are part of a conspiracy to defeat their religious goals like all messianic cults they have martyrs and heroes and a powerful faith in the sanctity of dying for one s beliefs they strongly believe in expanding their numbers by breeding the average family has six children and talking to the children is like talking to the brainwashed mrs shani horowitz originally from new york moved to hebron because she wanted to live somewhere where by just sitting i was doing something for the jewish people in passionate and often angry tones she says the hebron settlers are like the early jewish pioneers who built the state of israel through settlement hebron is spiritually and geographically the centre of jewish life because we live here jews can come and visit the sites and holy places we are the messengers we are sitting here for the rest of the country evacuating hebron is like evacuating the wailing wall hebron is the second most important jewish city after jerusalem we are very much on the front line on a mission as soldiers we are holding on tight to the land of israel we are redeeming this place from being barren of jews the government s timid moves against the settlers has exposed the weakness of mr rabin s political will he fears that acting against the hebron settlers will fuel right wing opposition to the peace process and force the government into surrendering a powerful pawn in the drawn out negotiation with the palestinians but the government s refusal clearly to state the long term line of its withdrawal from occupied arab land has bound all 125 000 settlers together in common cause with the hebron settlers the belief is that any move against hebron is the thin edge of the wedge most of the cabinet realise that hebron and some other settlements will have to be evacuated sooner or later the more the government delays the more strongly organised the settlers become yesterday hours before an anti government demonstration the yesha council of jewish settlements said it is inconceivable that a jewish government could make hebron judenrein clean of jews the rabin government has no mandate for an ethnic cleansing of hebron or to carry out its policies of capitulation to the plo the settlers are preparing a campaign of fierce civil disobedience against any effort to evacuate them they have urged the army to disobey orders and implicitly threaten violence if the government tries to evacuate hebron it will be a declaration of war against the jewish people said mr noam arnon a hebron settler we are not going to move we are not going alive they will have kill us mr arnon says settler leaders are calling for non violence because they know that violence damages their cause but he warns that if the army leaves hebron settlers will take up arms against the arabs in a civil war jewish law has a strong prohibition against jewish on jewish violence but mr arnon says that if the army tried to evacuate hebron by force with deep emotional and religious feeling people might lose self control then horrible terrible things might happen with up to 15 000 army issued automatic weapons in the settlers hands ten of thousands of licensed handguns and the possibility of secret arms caches these are threats the government cannot take lightly but the more the government delays a political decision on settlements the more the settlers threaten the fragile peace process and the stability of the government itself\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3542", "title": "ft 16 mar 94 cfa zone plea",

conservative led coalition is facing a desperate search for cash to meet its ongoing expenses it is a problem that will almost certainly affect the performance of mrs ciller s truth path party dyp in municipal elections across the country on march 27 turkey is in the middle of the most damaging financial crisis since the banking collapse of the early 1980s after a decade of capital market reform recent currency turbulence has underlined just how vulnerable the economy is to policy error with interest rates on government paper having risen to 125 per cent and the international bond markets for developing country debt suffering the jitters in the wake of the rise in us rates turkey is finding it increasingly costly to borrow privatisation receipts have not been as large as projected meanwhile most of the tax changes recently introduced will not have an impact on revenues until 1995 the government s problems deepened last week when it was forced to pull its dollars 750m global bond issue there are civil servants and public works contractors to pay farm prices to subsidise and debts to service and bankers are worried a big liquidity crunch is on the way the road builders are just the latest creditors to come knocking on the government s door the contractors had to settle for a package of tax relief and three year bonds in lieu of the dollars 700m owed for work completed the work programme for 1994 has been sharply curtailed the government s response to the crisis and the run on the lira has been far from convincing sir leon brittan the european trade commissioner during a visit to ankara last month urged the turkish authorities to introduce austerity measures to underpin the gains from the 12 per cent devaluation in january instead mrs ciller set alarm bells ringing by suggesting treasury bill liabilities should be converted into new five year paper in effect a domestic rescheduling what was puzzling was the treasury s announcement that it is to issue convertible bonds in the state telecom company even though the telecom company is still not privatised and all moves to prepare it for sale remain blocked by the courts there were even press reports quoting government officials that undercover agents had been ordered to infiltrate the money markets in the belief that it was kurdish separatists who were trying to destabilise them the crisis reflects the loss of local and international confidence in mrs ciller s leadership the bold rhetoric that accompanied her appointment has never been matched by the reality of her policies her reformist instincts have been frequently blocked by opposition from her coalition partners the social democratic populists everyone has lost out said one disillusioned turkish businessman the central bank s reputation has been damaged so has the treasury s reserves are depleted and the small investor has got badly burnt polls suggest that in the municipal elections on march 27 mrs ciller s dyp

popularity since she was voted party leader by the dyp congress last june a professional economist and a political outsider mrs ciller seemed to offer the best hope of restoring the country s fortunes and forging its western identity today if mrs ciller survives the current turmoil it will probably be less the result of any real political achievement than the fact that the dyp is unable to find a credible alternative leader her policies centred on finding ways to finance the budget rather than addressing the need to bring the deficit to heel are attacked by leading economists her attempts at more structural changes such as pushing through large scale privatisation tax reforms and curbing civil service pay rises have been limited because of divisions in her coalition and have done little to ease budget pressures also criticised has been her management style on which the resignations of two successive central bank governors have been blamed what was seen as her mishandling of the 12 per cent devaluation in january badly dented the bank s prestige moreover central bank reserves have fallen by as much as dollars 3bn since the beginning of the year to about dollars 4 5bn early this month some bankers say mrs ciller has in large part brought the troubles on herself the local bond market has all but dried up as a direct result of her unorthodox and ultimately failed attempt to push down domestic bill rates the current uncertainty has pushed rates on government paper up 30 points since the second half of 1993 even at 125 per cent for one year paper there are few buyers as one banker put it it s no longer enough to have an interest rate policy something more is needed after 7 per cent growth in 1993 forecasts for this year are being marked down one western economist says turkey could see negative growth in 1994 making it even more difficult for business to rebuild in such a climate said one economist bankruptcies would be unavoidable particularly for those dependent on government payments such as contractors banks too will feel the pinch caught out with large foreign exchange exposure at a time when the lira s depreciation is accelerating today turkey displays all the symptoms of an economy where inflation is heading out of control no one wants to hold lira on pay day turkish civil servants rush to the exchange shops even divorces are sometimes settled in hard currency some foreign banks worry the lira could fall even more sharply unless a serious structural reform programme is introduced few turkish observers hold out much hope of that in

altogether more modest mr rudolf scharping the state premier of the rhineland palatinate this time he was coming back as a winner from the very first poll of germany s 1994 election marathon which will see 18 more polls culminating in the general election on october 16 his emergence from sunday s state election in lower saxony with an absolute majority albeit only of one seat means that he can rule without any coalition partner that is a luxury enjoyed by the government in only five other states of the 16 in the federal republic mr schroder was magnanimous in his victory he paid tribute to the greens who had been his partners in the first red green coalition in germany and will undoubtedly still be needed to provide some support for his wafer thin majority at the end of sunday night his spd had won 81 of the 161 seats in the hanover based state parliament against 67 for the christian democratic union and 13 for the greens the biggest losers were the chancellor helmut kohl s cdu which lost 5 6 percentage points to win just 36 4 per cent of the vote and the free democratic party fdp his coalition partner in bonn which failed to gain the minimum 5 per cent needed to win any seats at all yet mr schroder s main warning was to his own spd party colleagues not to relax in the forthcoming election campaigns and regard them as good as won and he spoke out strongly against national policies which might prove disastrous vote losers in the campaign such as a national speed limit on the autobahns and an increase in taxes on petrol and oil products mr schroder whose victory is seen very much as a personal triumph admitted he was facing an exhausted cdu in lower saxony with a serious shortage of personalities in its leadership yet one man had shown he could make a difference in the last two weeks of the campaign he said the arrival of mr kohl himself showed that the ruling party could still boast a notable and battle hardened election campaigner who should never be under estimated it was no doubt a neat reminder to his erstwhile spd rival mr scharping about the harsh struggle ahead mr schroder pledged his loyal support to his national leader but he firmly ruled out any future role in bonn for himself he was speaking just five days before the next test in the election marathon when 2 1m voters in the state of schleswig holstein must elect new local councils on sunday and where the spd itself is facing a backlash in the polls state officials of the cdu are hoping to push the spd into second place and to emerge once again as the largest party reversing the positions of 1990 the biggest loser from the lower saxony election was the free democratic party which failed to gain even the minimum 5 per cent needed to win seats in the state parliament and in

these policies and the underlying belief that the market provides the most reliable way of allocating resources in an economy have acquired the status of an unimpeachable conventional wisdom in the third world s more or less open armed embrace of market forces the biggest loser of all has been the state whose former prominence in economic decision making has been pretty thoroughly undermined ironically lenin s catchy prediction that the state would wither away is apparently being proved right albeit not quite in the way envisaged here is a book that draws attention to the state s miserable fate over the past decade or so most of its 11 essays try to poke holes in the argument that the market necessarily delivers the best possible results for developing countries some of the authors do this by relying on economic theory others do it by looking at some of the bad side effects of the adjustment process hoping to show that something must be wrong with economic policies that frequently leave the most disadvantaged groups in a society worse off than before the best of the theory laden essays is a provocative but jargon filled effort by peter smith who challenges the idea that any step towards a market based solution must be better than nothing one of the biggest problems he sees is that the arguments in favour of the market are usually couched in terms of the theoretical ideal of perfect competition which is supposed to lead to an optimal situation where no one person can be made better off without making somebody else worse off unfortunately as smith points out the real world is rarely if ever perfectly competitive and policymakers can make big mistakes by assuming that it is indeed the presence of an obstacle to free competition and exchange may require the introduction of taxes regulations and so on elsewhere to restore optimality paradoxically there are times when markets work better with more state intervention not less by far the more successful essays in this book are the ones that pay more attention to the real world than to theory dharam ghai s essay on structural adjustment shows how one of the legacies of the 1980s has been a

increased their share of the world s income from 74 per cent to 83 per cent while the countries with the poorest 20 per cent of the world s population saw their share of global income dwindle to just under 1 5 per cent meanwhile income inequalities and the level of absolute poverty have increased throughout most of latin america and africa and ghai worries about the effect these developments will have on social cohesion in developing countries a similar picture emerges from frances stewart s essay on the effects that adjustment policies have had on education adjustment puts pressure on public finances and in most cases leads to falls in real wages stewart argues that this combination has reduced not only the supply of education by the state but also the demand for education poor households with falling incomes find it more difficult to send their children to school since they become more dependent on the wages that children can earn if they work rather than spend time getting educated in turn this can lead into a vicious circle as countries lose all the benefits of having an educated people these benefits extend well beyond the obvious one better labour productivity since they affect a nation s overall welfare too babies are more likely to die prematurely if they are born to uneducated mothers who will overcompensate for their loss by having even more babies stewart s plea with which it is difficult not to sympathise is for governments to try to combine adjustment with growth or at least to protect education from the effects of deflationary adjustment either by spending a little less on defence say or by concentrating harder on revenue raising than on expenditure cutting the book provides some good evidence that we live in a world that cries out not so much for less government but for better government recently it seems a number of countries are latching on to this in mexico chile and argentina political debate has become much more focused on the need for governments to be more effective providers of welfare particularly to eliminate poverty still the question remains could governments in these countries ever have raised the resources needed to eliminate social injustice had they not shunned their way through economic reform\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3578", "title": "ft 15 mar 94 ft review of business books 25 the mellowing of mintzberg christopher lorenz believes there has been a reversal of a noted campaigner s past extremism strategic planning", "body": "the rise and fall of strategic planning by henry mintzberg prentice hall pounds 19 95 458 pages henry mintzberg a management professor at montreal s mcgill university has spent the last 20 years campaigning around the world against the ultra rational mechanistic highly detailed and mainly top down sort of strategic planning popularised in the 1970s by the boston consulting group and in the 1980s by harvard s prof michael porter the results of such planning processes are often rendered inadequate or even dangerous by shifting events in their place he has championed the diametrically opposed idea that strategy is only effective if it is created by a trial and error process of crafting a combination of intuitive anticipation and rapid reaction to events rather than being planned in deliberate detail beforehand on the misguided assumption that companies can know the future the mintzberg doctrine is that effective strategies often emerge from outside events or from the everyday actions of entrepreneurial managers at all levels since the mid 1980s his message has penetrated a growing number of companies over the same period events in the real world of politics economics and industrial competition have reinforced the realisation that no amount of detailed planning can help companies such as general motors ibm kodak philips and volkswagen react to let alone anticipate and mould their constantly shifting environment one might therefore expect a book with this title to be a mere celebration of the defeat of mintzberg s bete noir the left brain processes linear verbal analytical and purely rational which have always dominated the teaching and practice of corporate strategy the book certainly celebrates the sort of right brain thinking intuition pattern recognition and synthesis which he has always advocated but it does much more than that in a phrase it represents the mellowing of mintzberg his documentation of planning s fall from grace is thorough in the extreme he explains at length for instance why there is such a gulf between strategy and planning the first may be either an emergent pattern or what he calls a deliberate perspective he defines the second as merely a formalised system for codifying elaborating and operationalising the strategies which companies already have most of his criticisms of the old strategic planning school are fair if brutal it suffers from two key fallacies he says the first is that thought should be detached from action with strategy decided only by top management and central staff rather than by practising managers the second fallacy is that planning despite being a purely analytical activity can create the sort of synthesis which is required to develop strategy as he says strategy making is an immensely complex process involving the most sophisticated subtle and at times subconscious of human cognitive and social processes lesser butts of mintzberg s criticism include top management s mistaken faith in supposedly hard data the propensity of some managers still to cling to the discredited world of medium and long term forecasting and the enthusiasm of others for the multiple scenario techniques pioneered by shell only on the last of these does mintzberg misread reality and mislead the reader shell s approach is not as he claims based on the idea that since the future is unpredictable then by speculating on a variety of futures you might just hit upon the right one in reality the essence of shell s admittedly complicated approach is to encourage managers to develop strategies which are resilient to very different possible futures mintzberg s peccadillo is unfair but not venal enough to take the edge off the freshness of the final quarter of the book where he rehabilitates planning and planners instead of working in their old top down way mintzberg argues that planners have critical roles to play in support of line managers they should challenge managerial thinking by posing the right questions not by seeking the right answers they should help articulate justify and elaborate fill out the strategic vision of leaders at any level mintzberg calls this sort of activity strategic programming but says it need not always be formal instead he even acknowledges that planners may need in some cases to act as what he calls strategy finders recognising and broadening the impact of strategies emerging unnoticed from the organisation s experimentation and messy learning or from the actions of its competitors in other words a degree of rationality and planning matters after all too much planning may lead us to chaos but so would too little and more directly mintzberg concludes that is obvious commonsense but it is still quite a volte face from his past extremism in many ways the book s title should be reversed to the fall and rise of planning\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3579", "title": "ft 15 mar 94 ft review of business books 26 how the others do it business cultures", "body": "the seven cultures of capitalism by charles hampden turner and alfons trompenaars doubleday new york dollars 25 404 pages this new study offers insight into how different business cultures and value systems influence behaviour and success in the commercial worlds of seven countries it stems from a questionnaire given to 15 000 managers from the us uk france germany the netherlands sweden and japan between 1986 and 1993 the framework used to compare their values and business cultures is a set of seven valuing processes that come into play when a society chooses how to create wealth the first valuing process is making rules and discovering exceptions each country and each organisation within it must set generalised rules procedures and routines while at the same time making special exceptions to those rules the other six cover the extent to which a culture analyses or integrates relies on the individual vs the community feels in control of its fate vs control by external forces does things in sequence vs in synchronisation expects status to be achieved vs ascribed and desires equality vs hierarchy many of the responses are illuminating for example should a poorly performing subordinate who you know has trouble at home expect your protection against others in the department most american managers 95 per cent said the subordinate had no right to protection attitudes were similar in germany 94 per cent sweden 91 and britain 84 by contrast only 56 per cent of japanese and 43 per cent of french managers agreed with this view the book devotes three chapters each to the us and japan and some of the most interesting material concerns the differences in the way they approach almost every dimension of business the analysis explains why the two countries have found their trade negotiations so difficult the authors explain the more subtle reasons why things go wrong the american preference for analysis leads them to seek clarification of the details first after all reason americans if the numbers don t add up there is no point in going to a lot of trouble to develop a relationship the japanese on the other hand prefer integrating which makes them approach a situation cautiously they need to sense whether a harmonious working relationship is possible and whether the potential partners are trustworthy before they bother with the numbers the japanese manager feels he can deal with the details further down the road if the relationship has potential to succeed the chapters on germany france britain sweden and the netherlands each show a depth of understanding that is rare in the comparative genre the authors explain why the us with its universalist individualistic analytical egalitarian mindset has been so successful at producing products with universal appeal such as mcdonalds levis and coca cola these values however also handicap the us in important ways they stifle creativity and discourage managers from relying on mentors or caring for employees they encourage high executive turnover reducing the incentive to train anyone they foster hostile takeovers and an over reliance on profitability as a yardstick of success the chapter on britain offers a rich and complex explanation of why its industry is in decline one of the main culprits say the authors is that britain has been unable to resolve the seven value dilemmas wealth creation is a function of the resolution of dilemmas facing a national economy the problem with britain is that it has a love affair with words it enjoys intelligent discourse oratory rhetoric anything other than solving the dilemmas the authors recite

days of full employment in the late 1940s to today s flexible labour market they also relate this to a wider political context the book shows how the minimalist system based on voluntarist principles so called laissez faire collectivism that believed employers and trade unions alone should decide the outcomes of collective bargaining came under pressure from the demands of an increasingly interventionist state committed to full employment and economic growth from the early 1960s successive government attempts were made to replace or modify voluntarism with a more legally regulated system the authors themselves would like to see the creation of a more stable yet juridified system of labour law in britain which would combine individual industrial justice with collective

ithaca new york dollars 40 00 hardback dollars 18 25 paperback 278 pages the american workplace is being transformed at a rapid pace under the impact of global market pressures companies are cutting costs and improving their competitiveness at a time when collective bargaining and private sector trade unionism face the prospect of virtual extinction now that only 12 per cent of workers are organised as a result an important debate has begun in the us over the future of employee rights as richard edwards asks how can the employer s need for flexibility in his operations be reconciled with workers legitimate aspirations for basic protections and fair dealing at work present trends suggest that the us is returning to the adversarial labour management relations that characterised much of the pre new deal workplace the demand for labour flexibility and reinforcement of the employment at will doctrine may be understandable among employers who fear their position is being undermined by free trade and deregulation on global markets but as edwards argues in his thoughtful book autocratic management has severe limitations when market pressures require companies to create and retain highly motivated loyal hardworking employees is it really credible for companies to try to build up trust and security with their employees but also demand an unquestioned power to hire and fire them the author suggests that collective bargaining is no longer a realistic option in dealing with that conundrum because unions today represent far too few workers to serve as the centerpiece for workers rights apparently collective bargaining can no longer be regarded as the core institution for a new regime of workers rights nor does edwards pin much faith in the statutory provision of workplace rights as an alternative arguing that there are severe limits on the state s ability to legislate and that legal regulation can be clumsy expensive and highly ineffective instead he argues for the legal codification of what he calls enterprise rights the detailed guides provided by companies for their workers individually that spell out their terms and conditions of employment the author believes employers must find a mutual interest with their workers to ensure an effective accepted and responsible system of industrial governance unless they recognise this he argues they must expect workers to press hard for new federal government regulations to extend their individual workplace rights to protect themselves against arbitrary management by making employee handbooks legally enforceable with access to independent arbitration edwards believes he can create a new common ground where legitimate aspirations contribute positively to employers competitive needs but is this realistic edwards himself admits perhaps a majority of american employers offer virtually no enterprise rights at all such so called rights where they do exist are unilaterally provided by companies so they can easily be abrogated when or if necessary it is hard to see why companies should agree to have their own employee guides made legally enforceable because it would restrain their unilateral right to manage perhaps edwards should have looked at ways of helping to renew trade unionism as the answer to the genuine problem of workplace rights eileen appelbaum and rosemary batt suggest in their highly informative survey that corporate america contrary to its adversarial image may be pragmatic enough to adapt to workplace change through co operation rather than conflict certainly they found a surprisingly large number of us companies willing to experiment with progressive forms of workplace organisation total quality management just in time production joint teamwork and the rest than might have been expected the authors estimate that a quarter to a third of firms have made significant changes on how workers are managed with serious quality at work programmes but their book also pinpoints obstacles to change in the american system notably the lack of an institutional infrastructure ensuring that organisational innovation is overly dependent on the personalities and commitments of key individuals moreover the ideological opposition to job security regulation makes it difficult for transformed firms which rely on mutual trust to honour commitments they have made to employment security during periods of recession the authors point to successful employer union partnerships at rank xerox with the clothing and textile workers and the saturn project between general motors and the united autoworkers for example to suggest that organised labour is not as anachronistic as many human resource pundits suggest indeed the implied but unfashionable conclusion from both books is that collective bargaining and union workplace representation may not be such obsolete concepts after all perhaps american employers faced with the tidal force of global change should question their instinctive dislike of trade unions by sharing responsibility in achieving growth and profitability with their workers through collective representation companies in many sectors

the genre an easy read the bad news is that the information it contains scarcely seems to justify the cover price the first half is a trot through the highways and byways of personal finance this is fine as far as it goes but can be obtained better and cheaper elsewhere to be fair what slater has to say about endowment policies he doesn t like them is very sensible perhaps a greater surprise to the newcomer is that such a renowned stockpicker has so many kind words to say about index tracking funds nevertheless one doubts whether many people will want to pay pounds 25 to receive his thoughts on such subjects i am sure the main appeal of a book from slater is the belief that he has the knack of picking wonder stocks in this sense his labyrinthine wheelings and dealings in the 1970s which prompted so much criticism at the time may just add to his appeal as a financial magician such investors will turn to the second half of his book headed more active investment for the section on shares what they will find is a boiled down version of slater s previous book the zulu principle to which he makes repeated references those who have read the earlier book published for a more modest pounds 18 99 will not need to read this again slater enthusiasts are probably better off with the earlier tome of course one might argue that pounds 25 is a snip if the reader can discover the secret of successful stock market investment but will they slater s main enthusiasm is for growth shares companies with a long record of strong earnings growth he emphasises the peg the relationship between a share s prospective price earnings ratio and the company s expected earnings growth rate the aim is to find companies with pegs of less than 1 that is where the expected growth rate is higher than the p e growth stocks can of course be highly profitable the problem is that they command a high price and if their earnings disappoint the fall in share price can be both sharp and swift stock markets can be temporarily dazzled by such companies so relying on prospective p es and forecasts for earnings growth can be dangerously misleading slater himself refers to the dangers at one point he writes during 1993 after some painful investment experiences with shares like sage and micro focus i decided to avoid investing in any further computer software companies what he does not mention is that sage received quite a lengthy write up in the zulu principle and that both stocks were tipped in his independent column bad luck on those who followed his earlier advice other stocks tipped by slater may have done well but as a quick test of his methods i looked at the performance of the six shares which would have been picked out of the ft a 350 index in may 1993 on the basis of slater s criteria betterware inchcape rentokil rothmans tibbett britten and wellcome while slater says i want to make it clear that i am not recommending the purchase of any of these shares this is largely because circumstances will have changed between may 1993 and the time the reader buys the book nevertheless since he spends much space trumpeting the method it seems reasonable to ask how well those shares have performed since may the answer is not very well in the nine months between may 1 and february 1 1994 the six shares rose by an average 3 83 per cent after allowing for some tricky calculations on rothmans over the same period the all share index was up by 25 6 per cent of course someone using slater s methods today might easily produce a portfolio of outperforming shares the

to have been early exponents of the art now known as management by wandering around mbwa and the way in which radical new ideas are only accepted when the time is ripe is explored through the markedly different stories of the religious reformer martin luther and that recently deceased american missionary of industrial quality w edwards deming at a time when many multinationals are trying to shake off any national identity perhaps the likes of abb s chief executive percy barnevik can learn something from the way the roman empire enlisted the allegiance of different peoples and blended different

interpretation to a minimum like a 1970s style ceo trajan hadrian s predecessor expanded the roman conglomerate still further is the sort of sentence that for some readers will jar luecke admittedly goes out of his way to stress the limitations as well as the lessons of history he quotes the ill fated memorandum which compared the situations facing the french in 1954 and the americans in 1965 and

always regarded my domestic supply based as it is on electricity dribbling from the end of a rural supply line in kent as a fairly accurate indicator of the health of the electricity supply industry when prior to privatisation the central electricity generating board warned that the security of supply would be seriously impaired if generation was separated from the national distribution grid i stocked up with candles and yet this proved to be just one of the many myths and weaknesses exposed by the privatisation of the industry one of the most complicated and ambitious attempted by any government the cegb for instance claimed its system was the envy of the world and yet as alex henney shows time and time again the board was inefficient complacent and downright misleading when it came to presenting the true cost of nuclear power the industry was producer dominated with the area electricity boards having little influence over or one suspects little understanding of its wholesale price the bulk supply tariff management was patchy and over influenced by trade unions while the electricity council the central co ordinating body was largely ineffectual it must be said that there was little malevolence in all of this the managers and staff did their best indeed their dedication to public service demonstrated admirably in the aftermath of the 1987 hurricane has often been undervalued it was the basic structure of the industry that was wrong it was also highly politicised for all of its shortcomings privatisation has produced a considerable improvement on the original system the industry is much more commercially aware power and influence has been transferred to where it should always have been the distributor or regional electricity companies recs this commercialism this desire for a quick return has inevitably put strains on other strategically important energy industries however it has given rise to the dash for gas in generation it has accelerated the run down of the coal industry while opening the import gates to foreign often subsidised coal it has also put a question mark over the longer term future of the currently aided nuclear industry the lack of an energy policy is all too evident a former chairman of the london electricity consultative council alex henney has been a long time critic of the supply industry in this study he has provided a comprehensive analysis of the financial and operational processes of privatisation given the complexity of the subject and it did take an army of 600 experts to plan the process he is to be commended for mastering the detail where this book disappoints is in its lack of personality little is recorded of the tensions and arguments that punctuated and in part shaped the privatisation debate why was it for instance that sir philip jones chairman of the electricity council was sidelined from events in spite of his substantial whitehall experience and propensity for grappling with complex issues what of lord marshall former chairman of the cegb and the world s most colourful and controversial exponent of nuclear energy when in 1989 the government decided to exclude all nuclear reactors from privatisation he was invited to resign that is all we are told and then there were the chairmen of the area boards they were far from united in the privatisation

newspaper content media", "body": "advertising and a democratic press by c edwin baker princeton university press dollars 24 95 pounds 20 203 pages incl 50pp of notes critics of advertising usually point to its role in promoting an ultimately unsustainable consumerist view of the world or its potentially disruptive impact in thrusting luxurious lifestyles under the noses of those who cannot afford them prof edwin baker has an even graver charge to level at the industry at least in the us that it has destroyed diversity and competition in the american press and at least to a degree debauched its standards he believes advertisers pose an even greater threat than politicians to press freedom despite the potential danger and occasional occurrence of government censorship private entities in general and advertisers in particular constitute the most consistent and the most pernicious censors of media content prof baker argues for the author the most deadly case of advertiser influence was the mass media s virtual silence about the dangers of cigarette smoking long after these effects were well known to the medical community to protect media revenues from cigarette advertising the power of advertising can extend throughout the media conglomerates such as when a new york times series on medical malpractice so upset pharmaceutical companies that they threatened to withdraw 260 pages of advertising from a medical magazine owned by the paper rather than buckle the new york times sold the magazine however the central thesis of the book is that advertisers have played a fundamental role in destroying competition in the us newspaper industry by 1989 only 26 us cities still had competing dailies this process of consolidation which has on the whole produced a bland timid non partisan press according to prof baker has largely resulted from the fact that the largest paper in an area gets a disproportionate amount of advertising the increasing subsidisation of the cost of editorial material leads to increasing dominance and the collapse of rivals as rival papers become uneconomic overall circulations fall because the survivors do not acquire all the subscribers of the deceased titles prof baker believes that a commitment to democracy strongly supports the treatment of media content as a merit good to which all citizens should have access at least to some reasonable extent the author has one relatively simple suggestion to make to cure the problem to reduce the influence of advertising on newspapers prof baker would place a 10 per cent sales tax on newspaper advertising and redistribute the money as a subsidy based on a paper s circulation revenue this might reduce advertising revenue by 10 per cent but could increase revenues from circulation by 30 per cent rewarding newspapers that pleased their readers a similar process could apply to broadcasting in 1989 for example a 6 per cent tax on television advertising would have provided dollars 1 78bn to fund public broadcasting whether such an interventionist approach amounts to practical politics or not advertising and a democratic press is an essential book for anyone interested in the structural impact of advertising on american newspapers in particular and the american media in general it is less clear how relevant such an analysis is for the british press although advertising subsidises newspapers to a significant extent a reasonable diversity of views has survived even though left of centre opinions are considerably under represented the relevance to europe of prof baker s views cannot however be dismissed entirely he cites the well known case of the daily herald when it ceased publication it was read by 4 7m people nearly twice as many as the times ft and the guardian added together the problem was not a lack of readers but that the herald s readers were disproportionately poor working class and consequently did not constitute a valuable advertising market to reach ironically a free marketeer like rupert murdoch appears to be moving in prof baker s direction by cutting the price of the times to 30p by doing so he has based his main hope for the paper s future on increased circulation revenues by persuading more people to buy the paper rather than courting advertisers by offering a narrow elite readership\n"}, {"id":

which is as much as one can hope for in this life for the non economist their book is a tough read in parts and much of the regulatory and industry detail is less than vital to non us readers but their essential argument consists of two propositions that there is room for more competition in local telephony and that the current us regulatory structure is woefully inadequate as a mechanism for promoting efficient competition the first proposition is gaining increasing international acceptance in the us competitive access providers have been growing fast competing against the local bell companies to provide businesses with access to the long distance carriers the regulatory structure looks set to loosen further with cable companies allowed to offer telephony services and vice versa the speed of the change is remarkable given america s history of legislative sclerosis bills currently before congress and likely to pass in some form would repeal cable telephone cross ownership rules although they would still prohibit telephone companies from buying cable systems in their own service areas a separate bill would permit the local bell companies to compete with at t and the other long distance carriers to an extent the us is following the uk s lead three years ago the government decided to break the pre existing bt mercury duopoly and allow new operators to build local

that the us telecoms map is going to be rewritten overnight even if the draft legislation is enacted the recent decision of bell atlantic to call off its dollars 21 4bn merger with tele communications the largest us cable television service company citing the unsettled regulatory climate is a sign of the continuing difficulties a particularly thorny issue is that of universal access or as al gore puts it the imperative that there should not be information haves and have nots as yet there is no such concern in britain where the cable companies are regarded as providing an additional non essential service to their customers what does universal access mean special universal access payments by competitors offering new broadband services vouchers for the poor and or rural dwellers if the latter paid to whom and by whom these are key questions which will need to be answered if the inter active super highways are intended to provide universal service baumol and sidak concentrate on a revised regulatory system to promote competition essentially for the former monopoly carriers they want to move away from rigid service by service rate of return regulation to a price cap applying to the average price of services in a basket much as does oftel the uk telecommunications regulator for new entrants competing against an existing operator whose network they have to use to deliver their service the authors want to see access prices which include the opportunity cost involved in the existing operator losing market share to the new entrant they call this approach efficient component pricing it has the advantage they argue of only admitting competition that is truly efficient providing real service improvements and or price benefits to consumers furthermore they suggest it reduces concerns about new entrants simply cream skimming the more lucrative parts of an operator s business the question of course is how to set the efficient component prices but then setting access charges

mice pushed around the table shift a pointer to the desired picture and at the press of a button a little world of information or computer application jumps into life in a window on the screen the revolution began in 1984 with the birth of the apple macintosh computer after a fraught conception and traumatic delivery at the company s headquarters in cupertino california it was an insanely great idea said steve jobs apple s founder who inspired and maddened his team of young engineers they wore tee shirts and sneakers and were steeped in the alternative culture of california of the 1970s their mission was no less than to topple international business machines from its dominance of the personal computer market by producing a machine no longer an alien processor of digits but an extension of human intellect and creativity they failed the first apple mac introduced to the world with a fanfare of aspiration was flawed by inadequate power some rickety programming and jobs s misreading of the market the team that expected to change the world collapsed in exhaustion and despair and then dispersed jobs left apple and john sculley an apparently more conventional manager whom jobs had enticed from pepsi cola took complete charge slowly the fortunes of the mac improved it found an important niche in the publishing world and remains the only significant rival to ibm in personal computing but the real revolution is that the mac personality based on menus mice and icons has been cloned in the ibm world stephen levy a computer journalist tells this story with lively intelligence pace and a good dose of personal anecdote although a committed believer in the macintosh vision he does not mind exposing its faults and gives a lively picture of the mismanagement and extraordinary pockets of anarchy which flawed apple for some of this period he also offers a well observed portrait of jobs who emerges as insanely great rude arrogant self absorbed and sometimes fatally inattentive to detail or the work of others yet jobs was also as a kind of prophet he absorbed and implemented a vision of the machine as a true servant of the human intellect an idea proposed as far back as 1945 by vannevar bush a former vice president of the massachussetts institute of technology this historical context enables levy to project the recent revolution in personal computing

governance in five countries by jonathan charkham oxford university press pounds 19 95 389 pages banks finance and investment in germany by jeremy edwards and klaus fischer cambridge university press pounds 30 252 pages german industrial companies are widely believed to have a competitive advantage over their british counterparts because they are less subject to short term pressures from the stock market are less vulnerable to the threat of takeover and enjoy more constructive long term relationships with their banks and shareholders it is partly for these reasons that jonathan charkham in his study of corporate governance in five countries concludes not only that germany is the best but that britain s industrial decline will continue unless it moves closer to the german model that the german financial system is different from the british one is clear much less certain is the link between that difference and the industrial performance of the two countries too many assertions on this topic are based on misleading or partial accounts of how the german system works thus a useful complement to charkham s book is this careful study by edwards and fischer of the role of german banks in supplying funds to companies and in monitoring their management germany has fewer publicly quoted companies than britain and within this small group only a minority have widely dispersed shareholdings on the anglo american pattern most of them have a dominant shareholder with at least 25 per cent of the equity this is usually a non financial enterprise rather than a bank this structure has several implications first owner managed firms account for a much larger proportion of german industrial output than is the case in britain the small and medium sized unquoted companies which dominate much of german industry have little relevance to britain s corporate governance debate which is mainly concerned with the gulf between managers and shareholders most of these companies fall below the threshold at which supervisory boards are required the idea that bank representation on supervisory boards is important for german competitiveness must be qualified by the fact that firms with this structure account for no more than 30 per cent of total turnover in the german economy second edwards and fischer cast doubt on the view that in the large quoted companies the presence of banks on supervisory boards confers advantages in the provision of long term finance and in the early detection of financial stress or managerial failure there is no evidence that banks which are represented on boards of companies make more long term loans to those companies strong competition within the banking industry including the savings banks and the co operative sector limits the scope for exclusive relationships the house bank in a large firm is typically no more than first among equals in a group of several banks to the extent that banks become aware of impending financial strains it is in their role as lenders not as board members most banks loans are secured by collateral which reduces the banks incentive to intervene in troubled companies to stave off bankruptcy interviews conducted by the authors suggest that unlike japanese banks german banks do not in general get directly involved in the reorganisation of a firm in financial distress and do not possess any personnel who are specialists at turning unprofitable firms around in the case of large quoted companies the authors concede board membership may have some limited positive effect in encouraging them to intervene because their reputation is at stake the third distinctive feature of the german system is more relevant to the corporate governance issue where a shareholder has a stake of 25 per cent or more in a company it has a greater incentive to monitor management than the typical british or american institution whose shareholdings rarely exceed 1 2 per cent in addition the presence of large semi permanent investors makes hostile takeovers difficult if not impossible the holders of these large stakes are often suppliers or customers of the company concerned the shareholding is seen as part of a set of implicit contracts which encourages long term high trust relationships between the two parties there is stability and commitment missing in most british companies does this network of share stakes work to the benefit of all shareholders and of the german economy as a whole edwards and fischer point out that some of the companies including the three big banks which hold large stakes in other companies do not themselves have a dominant shareholder they are among the minority of cases where shareholdings are widely dispersed it is not obvious that the managers of these companies not subject to monitoring by their own shareholders have a strong incentive to monitor their fellow managers in the companies where they hold shares indeed there is a risk of managerial collusion to the detriment of both sets of shareholders representation of firms on each other s supervisory boards and in particular the extensive networks among firms which are created by common bank supervisory board representation may allow cartel arrangements to be made so that profitability increases for reasons unrelated to efficiency improvement that the system limits the scope for hostile takeovers may be an advantage but it is arguable that the absence of the take over threat has allowed some german companies to pursue expansionist ambitions which have been damaging to their own shareholders and of questionable benefit to the economy if british and american companies are too quick to dispose of temporarily loss making businesses the germans sometimes hold on to them for too long charkham accepts that the german system has a tendency towards rigidity but in his view it has a huge advantage over britain in providing a stable framework within which managers can take long term decisions on balance he thinks the fear of takeover is distracting destructive and inhibiting the need for hostile takeovers would be reduced if investors were more committed to companies and more active in overseeing their performance the necessary moves in this direction charkham argues will not occur without government intervention the first step would be the creation of a royal commission which would among other things reconsider the role and effects of hostile takeovers yet charkham provides no evidence that britain s industrial decline a central theme in the book is linked to weaknesses in corporate governance he notes for example that britain is not represented among the major players in the electronics and computer industries but in these two sectors the short termist us with all its failings in corporate governance is far stronger than long termist germany success in electronics has little to do with the presence or absence of hostile takeovers charkham is on stronger ground in calling for improvements in the composition and conduct of boards of directors the process by which non executive directors are appointed and the functions which they are expected to fulfil remains one of the least satisfactory features of the british system the other four systems which charkham describes those of germany france japan and the us all have their flaws but he thinks the british system is more flawed than most he comments approvingly that in japan there is a consensus that the shareholders interest does not have to be satisfied by a growing dividend stream shareholders interests may be pushed to the back of the queue this reflects a japanese concept of what companies are for which is very different from anglo american attitudes but whether the supposed downgrading of shareholders is a central ingredient in japanese economic success is another matter none of the five countries has found a perfect solution to the corporate governance problem just as the japanese and german system of interlocking share stakes has potential costs as well as benefits the same is true of britain s reliance on takeovers and an active stock market no doubt there are many things wrong with the management of british companies but there is no compelling evidence that the pressure on them to maximise shareholder value is a competitive disadvantage\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3593",

1920s and 1930s on another it provides evidence to challenge orthodox assumptions about the competitiveness and other perceived strengths of the british insurance industry westall a business historian at lancaster university was commissioned to write the early history of the provincial insurance company a small family owned concern which ranks among the uk s top 20 insurance companies the company still sticks doggedly to its independence an attitude which becomes less surprising when the measure of its early achievements is understood the origins of the provincial were not auspicious the company s founder james scott a bolton cotton magnate chose an insurance company in preference to investing in a local bleach factory the decision was motivated in part at least because it allowed scott s two sons and heirs to live in the lake district and was greeted with some scepticism by the insurance establishment moreover as westall tellingly describes the provincial emerged in a market dominated by a cartel of powerful insurance companies by the beginning of this century the biggest companies had built up an elaborate and effective cartel based on the tariff an agreed minimum price for insurance premiums the formation of the fire offices committee in 1868 had allowed systematic rate regulation in fire insurance to become formal and explicit and over the next 30 years a formidable system of market control was consolidated writes westall by 1903 an array of committees served by a professional staff controlled 73 tariffs covering virtually every class of fire insurance specifying in detail the form policies should take and the minimum premium rates to be charged for every aspect of risk the development was of the greatest importance he continues if the fire offices committee could prevent rate competition it would remove the most effective solvent of the bonds of goodwill which protected established companies from competitors trying to build up new market share the achievement of james scott and his sons samuel and francis was to break into this market one important tactic was the ability to set premiums at rates lower than those demanded by the tariff companies however the success of this tactic seems to have depended on three separate elements the provincial took an innovative approach to distribution which allowed it to reduce its expense base while the tariff companies sold insurance through an extensive network of agents serviced by a wide and ultimately costly network of branch offices by contrast provincial built up its connections with independent insurance brokers the forerunners of today s commercial brokers such as the bains in leeds who were prepared to deal with a number of separate companies the company was relatively quick to take advantage of opportunities to launch new products which emerged with some frequency amid rapid technological and social change initially specialising in fire insurance for lancashire mill owners provincial broke into the accident market which emerged after the introduction of compulsory workers compensation insurance in 1906 for example this was a buoyant business free of traditional links this allowed less well established companies to use rate competition to grow with the market after the first world war provincial focused much of its attention on the motor insurance market which was an important new source of income for other non tariff insurers such as eagle star cornhill general accident and lloyd s of london provincial built up its share of the motor market by a selective underwriting strategy its offer of a country discount to motorists driving bigger cars and living in rural areas was not copied by more established competitors allowing the provincial both to increase its market share by a rate disproportionate to its size and to make profits finally samuel and francis scott took an adventurous approach to investment strategy one of two insurance companies advised by keynes the provincial invested more than 30 per cent of its funds in the equity markets at a time when most of its competitors favoured safer government bonds and loans and mortgages as a result provincial earned above average investment income and stole a significant march on its competitors who on the whole did not adopt this approach until the 1950s and 1960s despite the extraordinary changes in the investment environment during the inter war years most insurance investment continued to reflect late nineteenth century conventions says westall by 1938 the provincial had become a significant competitive element in the uk market and was making significant profits the family s original investment of pounds 75 000 was worth pounds 2 5m by 1938 an increase in value of about 20

cambridge university press pounds 50 639 pages the subject matter of this book is one of the most gripping stories in 20th century british business it tells how anglo iranian petroleum which had made the first commercial oil discovery in the middle east in 1908 and six years later fallen under majority control of the british government when it ran short of capital then became in the 1930s a leading member of the international oil industry before its dramatic nationalisation by the iranian government in 1951 the last page of the book contains a photograph taken in december 1954 showing two workmen replacing the anglo iranian plaque outside britannic house in finsbury square london with one reading the british petroleum company limited truly the formative period of a great british company had occurred during the years covered by this volume anglo iranian was britain s largest single overseas investment and its fortunes a matter for concern at the highest level in washington as well as london it thus found itself in the crosswinds of competing geopolitical interests located alongside britain s imperial passage to india anglo iranian was a crucial supplier of fuel to the british armed forces in two world wars for washington the undisputed priority by the early mid 1940s was the preservation of a friendly regime in a country whose northern borders adjoin the soviet union from a management point of view it was an explosive political blend the dominant figure at anglo iranian in the earlier part of this period was sir john later lord cadman who was chairman from 1927 to 1941 cadman a professor of mining turned whitehall technology adviser was international minded gregarious and an easy member of britain s ruling class his successor william fraser started out in his father s scottish shale oil company organised the transfer of that industry to anglo and became cadman s managing director in 1929 at the age of 35 as chairman from 1941 to 1956 this autocratic abrasive and uncompromising scot was regarded by civil servants as a dangerous liability to their delicate diplomatic efforts in teheran and washington dr bamburg who has become bp s in house historian since the first volume in this series was published in 1982 grants fraser a somewhat better press than in some other accounts although he agrees that the company could ill afford any shortcomings in the area of international relations and links with government in a period of such acute political turbulence against this he suggests that as cadman s managing director fraser was responsible for running and developing the business whilst cadman politicked at full throttle fraser also shared with cadman a commitment to technological advance and to financial caution the latter of which has not always been a quality typical of the oil industry or even of british petroleum among the managerial lessons of a story told here with abundant detail but insufficient colour narrative drive and thematic focus is that a good managing director does not necessarily make the right chairman and that a top executive who attains great heights at an early age needs to be watched lest he be content for an undemanding board to grow old with him there was the author notes a creeping movement towards gerontocracy it is also evident that from its earliest days anglo iranian s top management failed to delegate clearly to those nominally running its crucial persian activities perhaps this was a function of the company s excessively narrow focus on production and refining in iran that can only be partly excused by the political pressure it felt from teheran to pump up oil volumes and revenues in a period which like the present was characterised by global over supply and abortive attempts to erect pricing and marketing cartels this failure in strategic thinking in the pre war years was thus reinforced by an unsatisfactory managerial structure and perhaps reflected also in a lack of invention and drive on the marketing side of bp where executives tended to look for the nearest shared distribution deal rather than attacking the market with determination and originality meanwhile bp s handsomely profitable business created few incentives to attack the bureaucracy which was spreading its tentacles in london some will find the most enjoyable page in this book a memorandum from an external consultant on the daily pattern within one grossly overstaffed section of the company at 3 15 pm this report noted again an air of relaxation became apparent as tea and cake were expected after tea there was a general feeling that the back of the day s work was broken and clerks felt themselves at liberty to read crochet make out menu cards draw or gossip subsequent reforms the author writes had little impact on the overall shape of the managerial structure the drama of nationalisation however like all corporate crises brought its benefits anglo was forced to look beyond iran for supplies and to broaden its planning horizon by the time the plaque was changed in finsbury circus british petroleum was a much changed company although its struggle for regional balance and a more flexible culture has continued to the present day\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3597", "title": "ft 15 mar 94 ft review of business books 6 an academic manque john plender discovers how jack rose read the property cycle better than most developers autobiography", "body": "square feet by jack rose rics books pounds 9 95 169 pages few people are less like the conventional stereotype of the millionaire property entrepreneur than jack rose while others of his kind took elocution and dreamed of shooting pheasants on a country estate rose was busy rewriting the property industry s leasehold valuation tables when his company land investors had become one of britain s better known quoted property concerns his idea of a good time was to go out for an indian or chinese meal with his wife in an age when the fortunes of property developers have largely been dictated by the ebb and flow of bank credit this academic manque who never took any professional exams read the property industry cycle better than most above all jack and his younger brother philip who died in 1977 were famously risk averse having graduated from estate agency into development they allowed partners including such well known property men as harry hyams felix fenston and stanislas radziwill to take all the financial risk jack rose was the detail man who brought meticulous professionalism to the task of acquiring and undertaking developments only when he had established a secure financial base through a host of partnership deals was he prepared to take on the full risk of development the rose brothers good fortune was to have gone into property in time to exploit the opportunities thrown up by post war reconstruction in the period of cheap money in the 1950s and 1960s it was possible to raise an office block in the knowledge that the cost of acquisition and construction could be recouped from a long term mortgage debenture when the development was completed and let the rent on the building would cover the cost of servicing the debenture from the outset as long as demand for space remained strong and the planners perpetuated the shortage of supply created by the luftwaffe people with drive and market knowledge had a unique opportunity to become rich this did not prevent them from cutting corners as this autobiography makes engagingly clear rose s first employer built his country house estate agency business by ruthlessly poaching other firms clients when jack and philip rose set up their own estate agency they were forever putting up to let boards outside property without permission from the owner in the knowledge that the boards would stand for a potentially lucrative month or so before being removed at one time rose recalls anyone boarding a number 14 bus at marble arch and sitting on the top deck might well have thought that jack rose co owned most of oxford street the picture that emerges of the estate agency business is unflattering and wholly convincing the tale becomes even more picaresque when the roses advance to development as a landlord jack was not past breaking and entering premises at the weekend where the office tenants had legitimately refused him entry a friendly builder would then discreetly carry out improvements that were needed to make the building saleable to an institutional investor nor is the book reticent about the racy behaviour of others rose was at school with the late felix fenston a developer who did acquire a country estate and social graces fenston s grander friends might well have been surprised by rose s tale of how fenston cynically defrauded one of their earliest employers had these revelations appeared in a book by an investigative journalist they would probably have been noisily serialised in a sunday paper and caused a dreadful fracas there are not many prominent property people with whom jack rose did not have dealings yet it is characteristic of the man that he offers little in the way of anecdotes about legendary figures like cotton and clore and prefers instead to tell of sam champagne a multi millionaire cabbie who lived alone in a small flat and continued to drive his taxi to the end of his days sometimes taking fares from people he took to inspect his property yet rose the philanthropist and boffin cum entrepreneur has his silences and his quirks despite professing a love of painting and the arts he says little in this book about the appearance of the buildings that he developed the photographs suggest that there was plenty to be reticent about though no respecter of conventional wisdom he is surprisingly respectful both of the city and the property establishment and delights in his recent membership of the royal institution of chartered surveyors more endearing is his pleasure at having fulfilled his academic ambition by winning a master of philosophy s degree from reading university for a thesis on property interestingly he expresses no regret that his company was driven into receivership within four years of his selling out in 1986 though he does mildly regret having sold before the market peak had jack rose been born in the potteries instead of a pub in london s hoxton it would have been tempting to detect an echo here of arnold bennett s novel the card as it is the book contains plenty of nuggets about a fascinating highly individualistic industry as well as a revealing picture of the london in which the author spent his childhood the man shines through even perhaps especially when the prose

a definitive work tomorrow s economic giant", "body": "china the next economic superpower by william h overholt weidenfeld nicolson pounds 18 99 293 pages china is indeed shaping up to be the next economic superpower its remarkable success is easily visible to any visitor yet even after 15 years of open door policies the country s inner workings remain so well cloaked that it is a challenge for anybody seeking to chronicle its progress mr overholt then is a brave man a senior executive in hong kong with bankers trust the us bank he has observed asia s development at close hand he is not coy about emphasising in a five page author s note his qualifications apparently he was well in the vanguard in seeing the beneficial effects of the asian way of promoting economic growth before political freedom he also played a central but quiet role in the 1986 philippine revolution confreres beside whom he stood quietly at the barricades in manila might be surprised to find him arguing that democratically run third world countries don t have what it takes to forge economic success adopting democracy before economic reform he writes has virtually always led to economic strains so severe as to cause economic collapse more often than not followed by a reversion to dictatorship mr overholt styles himself as a lone western voice against western demands for all out and immediate political change in china this position draws him into sweeping generalisations in support of the chinese or asian way often belied by the evidence which he supplies in more sober moments sketching the compelling story of china s growth he is alert to the problems which may undermine success such as poor infrastructure bureaucracy lack of a legal system burdensome state industries fractious provinces and uncertain future leadership chinese officials might admit that the process has been more experimental than the controlled sequence suggested by mr overholt reform has moved ahead since this book was completed the author tends to take chinese statements too much at face value and approaches fervour when his twin enthusiasms for china and stock and bond markets are combined but he is also alive to the ironies and contradictions which follow from the grant of economic freedom to a people still ruled by a totalitarian propaganda machine for example that communist party secretaries who used to run companies now by passed often find themselves ensuring capitalist policies of foreign venture partners are followed by the workers nor can the central element of his thesis be denied clearly deng xiaoping s policy of opening up the economy before the political system has proved a great deal more successful than mikhail gorbachev s perestroika not only are mr deng and his party still at the helm but the whole country is better off even if the divide between rich and poor provinces has widened meanwhile russia sinks deeper into dissension and economic chaos however to observe that the asian model economic freedom now political liberalisation later has been successful in countries such as south korea taiwan and singapore is safer than to argue that this is the way in which countries like china should proceed each after all starts from a different set of circumstances asians who have for no reason suffered the tap on the door in the middle of the night incarceration torture or worse might ask why their freedom was incompatible with their country s economic progress they probably wanted prosperity too the case that political liberalisation is inappropriate for third world economic success and therefore that authoritarian regimes are appropriate is hardly self evident mr overholt argues that the need to win re election will always undermine reform policies which involve economic sacrifice and that reforms need time to mature without intervention by uneducated voters yet a prime motivation for mr deng s reforms was the communists recognition of the need to win a popular mandate to remain in power by reversing ideological principles which had led them to perpetrate a series of disasters on their people to observe that economic reform eventually produces political change so that s all right then is to admit that pressures for change have been resisted all along and finally cannot be denied by politicians and bureaucrats who have been determined to hang on to power it is all very well to assert that asian countries are different from western ones and operate by consensus economic reforms do take a long time westminster style democracy may indeed not be the best option but in the end the degree of consensus which a government has built behind its policies can only really be tested at the ballot box the first priority of such governments certainly should be to get their economic policies right and china is making a good stab at it mr overholt too should concentrate on the economics and the finance the politics are better left to others the latter parts of his book sadly lose coherence especially when he allows the bees in his bonnet to buzz about hong kong though he ends with a sound discussion of why it is in america s interest to deal with china rather than seek to isolate it with economic sanctions over human rights abuses there is a definitive book to be written about china s economic rise rapidly

a campaign for independent auditors to counter this problem although he fails to analyse why no such initiative has emerged even more controversially he suggests auditors can be seen as supporting

ownership matter edited by mark mason and dennis encarnation oxford university press pounds 39 95 459 pages although japanese investment in europe goes back as far as 1878 when mitsui opened its first office in paris it is only recently that it has reached significant proportions early investments interrupted of course by the second world war were mainly concerned with providing services to japanese companies hence shipping insurance and finance played a prominent role the change since the 1970s is the growth of manufacturing investment which has been heavily motivated by fears of trade protection this book is an early academic attempt to analyse these more recent flows in particular it seeks to compare the behaviour of japanese companies in europe and in the us as well as setting japanese patterns of investment in europe against those of the us its origin is a conference in 1992 for which the papers are being published together with commentaries from rapporteurs that are either bafflingly censorious or gushing in their praise that format is bound to restrict its readership to academic specialists as so often before the lay reader is struck by the slowness of academic publishing the sloppiness of the editing and the poor quality of much of the writing moreover such a wide ranging list of contributors is never going to agree entirely with one another but the book does assemble some new sets of data and it does have a certain message to impart which is that ownership does matter by establishing wholly owned subsidiaries in europe japanese companies have not only secured the distribution of their products they have also maintained control over the production process compared with us owners they still import a large number of components or did so when the research was carried out in that sense the motivation behind japanese foreign investment is more to do with trade supremacy in an environment of increasing physical barriers european companies rarely establish wholly owned subsidiaries in japan it may be that the culture which prevents them from doing so is one which also wants to ensure japanese supremacy in its own market it follows the book argues that european policymakers should be concerned with investment the book speaks in quite admiring tones of the way in which the european side implicitly put pressure on japanese car manufacturers not to flood previously restricted markets with output transplanted to european sites when barriers came down in the single market it suggests there may be lessons for us policymakers here too that however is dangerous stuff ultimately it is in nobody s interest that governments should discriminate in matters of investment competition is distorted efficiency gains lost and consumers suffer just as they do when trade in goods is protected european companies would benefit more from an open environment in which they could forge alliances that allow all to benefit from what

folkestone kent ct20 3ee pounds 19 99 379 pages one sunny april morning 104 years ago the small form of patrick lafcadio hearn an obscure provincial journalist stepped ashore at japan s yokohama dock after a long sea voyage from vancouver dazzled by the white sunshine of a perfect spring day hearn aged 39 felt that he had arrived in the land of dreams surrounded by strange gods he was to spend the 14 remaining years of his life there trying to see into the heart of this mysterious people as he modestly put it the experience transformed hearn from a failed victorian romantic writer into one of the greatest interpreters of japan s high speed transition in the late 19th century from a medieval to a modern society hearn fell in love with japan which he saw as an orderly refuge from his own turbulent past and a means to artistic fulfilment he married a japanese fell out of love with japan in his old age when he came to see the country as suffocatingly insular and became the first foreigner to be buried there with the buddhist rite this biography is not strictly speaking a business book yet it is an agreeable way of sharpening one s understanding of what makes this country tick at a time when japan is going through bewilderingly rapid change just as it was in hearn s time half irish and half greek this odd character has over the years become a mainstream literary figure for many japanese so an understanding of hearn throws some light on japan s soul hearn s popularity among japanese readers is understandable given his view of japan as a mirror to show to the west its own moral inadequacy the 12 books he wrote there also include a poetic record in the ghost stories for which he is best known in japan of an era for which many urban folk feel increasing nostalgia as japan becomes more western hearn s ideas clearly explained in this book are a useful guide to the traditions behind modern japanese behaviour his admiration for ju jutsu the art of applying an opponent s own strength to defeat him invites an obvious moral for anyone negotiating with japanese business or government some scholars have even claimed that the us would have understood japan better before pearl harbour if it had paid more attention to hearn s analyses of japan s moral and religious standards he was one of the first westerners to recognise the importance of shinto later a staple of japan s militarism hearn likened shinto to the ancestor worship practised by the ancient greeks and saw many other parallels between 19th century japan and ancient greek society to its credit paul murray s biography does not try to ram home pretentious modern lessons from hearn s life instead this is a straightforward account of hearn s multi faceted story by a biographer whose career as an irish diplomat in new york and tokyo parallels some of hearn s own travels it is hard to pick up a biography that shows as much respect for its subject s character as this one does because hearn was an unattractive prickly man always ill dressed unkempt slovenly with the face of a weasel and the manners of an oaf he was nevertheless one of the most brilliant and picturesque writers of his day in the words of one newspaper obituary one of mr murray s important themes is that hearn s strange life helped make him free from prejudice in explaining japan by comparison with the zealous christian missionaries and european minded professors writing about the country at the time and many commmentators since hearn s personal fantastic journey began on the greek island of lefkas from which he got his middle name in 1850 when he was born to an irish surgeon in the british army and a beautiful but illiterate local woman his parents soon split up leaving hearn to be brought up by an aunt in dublin in an environment of cultured leisure only to be packed off in his late teens to what appears to have been a brutal life in an english boarding school hearn left school at the age of 19 minus one eye lost during a game and a source of lasting psychological awkwardness to try his luck as a journalist in the american provincial city of cincinnati there he specialised in writing about the rotten underbelly of society including murders executions slaughterhouses and city corruption this taste for the grotesque later manifested itself in his prolific output of popular fiction hearn is an exponent of the victorian horror genre alongside bram stoker and edgar allan poe a short lived illegal marriage with the daughter of a negro slave in cincinnati precipitated a scandal hearn escaped to new orleans where he became the small town star of the local newspaper and started to publish his first works of popular fiction new orleans treated him well but the ever restless hearn wanted a taste adventure armed with a publishers commission he set off for the west indies for what turned out to be a disappointing two year stay in search of inspiration for more popular fiction hearn romantically claims that his decision to try japan for his next adventure began with the pleasure bordering on pain derived from looking at a paper fan with a simple bamboo design as mr murray explains the decision to emigrate to japan was more complicated chance played a part in keeping him there for the rest of his days ending in the arms of his japanese family in tokyo his life was appropriately for a journalist a great story moreover it is a story that contains a few pertinent messages for anybody trying to understand modern japan\n"}, {"id": "FT941-3603",

of derision from across the channel at the news that an exciting new british cheese was launched this week yet after the much publicised demise of lymeswold the imitation blue brie the marketing experts are convinced they have got it right this time the cheese company formerly express foods and britain s biggest independent cheese manufacturer is oozing confidence it has spent about pounds 500 000 developing churnton whose name is supposed to conjure up homely images of traditional cheese making and is splashing out pounds 2 5m on a saturation campaign of television and magazine advertising mail shots and in store tastings churnton is a hard cheese made to a secret recipe in the company s creamery in malpas cheshire it looks like a cheddar but with an open texture and has a fairly strong flavour unlike new specialist farmhouse cheeses churnton is aimed unashamedly at the mass of consumers who buy mild or medium cheddar for everyday use the cheese is being launched first in north west england where 18 per cent of households are heavy users of hard cheeses and will go national early next year the initial six week tv campaign began last night with a 30 second advertisement in the middle of coronation street featuring victoria studd the popular television presenter pronouncing after one taste you ll turn to churnton the sales line sprang from the success of trial tastings in safeway stores across the country in which eight out of 10 people said they would buy churnton again it is deliberately packaged to look like an ordinary cheddar so the trick is getting people to taste it in the first place says maria dooley marketing manager price will be important at this end of the market churnton will sell at a slight premium to mild or medium cheddar but the company has opted for fixed weight packs starting at 99p for 200g when buying variable weight packs of cheese people fish around for the ones that are below pounds 1 says dooley it might seem a gamble to target a new brand at a market which is 85 per cent dominated by supermarket own label cheeses roughly the reverse of france where branded regional cheeses abound and the retailing sector is more fragmented roger davenport managing director explains that the relative lack of branding in the uk is a result of the great success of major supermarket chains and their drive towards own label but any desire the supermarkets may have for innovation is stymied by conservative british tastes despite the range of hand made and imported cheeses on offer cheddar and other hard cheeses account for more than 75 per cent of sales that is why churnton is designed to be familiar while offering advantages in taste and texture he says the cheese company which was bought out by its management from grand metropolitan for pounds 96m only 16 months ago believes there is room for growth in the pounds 1 1bn uk market of which it expects churnton to capture about 2 per cent british cheese consumption is rising by 1 2 per cent a year but is still only half that of continental europe and a third of france churnton according to the launch publicity is the first british cheese to be developed for the regular weekly shopper in more than 50 years with weary determination davenport fields comparisons with lymeswold which was withdrawn in 1992 a decade after a triumphal start he says lymeswold raised such expectations that the manufacturer dairy crest could not meet them and began delivering a product that was not up to initial standards unlike churnton they didn t get much repeat purchasing he says whereas ours is very much mainstream lymeswold was always however successful going to be a niche product davenport is adamant that the cheese will not be found bland by its target consumers there is at least one auspicious sign when lymeswold was launched peter walker then agriculture minister was seen on television feeding chunks of it to his dog bomba gillian shephard the present incumbent

complaints about sexism", "body": "slapped wrists for uk advertisers accompanied the revelation this week that concern about sexist advertisements appears to be rising according to the advertising standards authority s annual report complaints from the public about the portrayal of women climbed from 180 in 1992 to 536 last year while the number of complaints that were upheld more than doubled from 52 to 111 there is a need for greater sensitivity over the use of sex and women in advertisements the asa warned but are advertisers really getting worse in their treatment of sex and women the indiscriminate use of semi clad women draped across car bonnets or pouting from double glazing advertisements for example seems to be less common than it once was an alternative explanation for the increase in complaints could be the sharpening of public sensibilities on such issues according to caroline crawford asa head of media relations a 1980 survey conducted by the authority showed that women were far more offended by the advertising of sanitary products than by the sexist advertising that was around at the time a decade later about one in three women felt a degree of animosity about the demeaning portrayal of women says crawford the figure for men who by this date had also been included in the survey was about one in five still the majority weren t that bothered but those who were bothered were very bothered it was an increasingly vocal group she says the increased use of nudity in recent years may also be a factor while not necessarily tasteless sexist or irrelevant to the product it is still likely to offend a few people the current wonderbra poster campaign is hard to miss and has drawn about 30 complaints to the asa so far however there are no plans to investigate says crawford the posters are of a confident woman of the 1990s who is very aware of her sexuality and is certainly not a victim she says likewise the recent haagen dazs ads which showed a couple in various states of undress enjoying ice cream was considered by the asa to be tastefully photographed and sensitively handled even says crawford if it couldn t be said to be completely relevant to the product the treatment probably would not offend the majority of people rita clifton director of strategic planning at advertising agency saatchi saatchi agrees that nudity in advertising has increased we re not as uptight about showing naked bodies they are now an acceptable public currency for many what is not acceptable any more if indeed it ever was is portraying a woman as a victim a stupid partner or somehow not in control of her own destiny on the whole the ad industry has to toe the line there are no inflexible rules either for printed advertisements governed by the asa or television commercials supervised by the independent television commission about which bits of the human body may or may not be shown instead advertisers have a general duty not to cause offence how that is interpreted in each case depends on the context treatment and innuendo for example a lingerie advertisement from scandinavian retailer hennes which showed no more cleavage than the wonderbra advertisement did fall foul of the asa the strapline on the poster read what the au pair will be wearing this winter says crawford men wrote in and said i employ an au pair and i object to the implication that all an au pair is good for is to act as a man s plaything what the public does object to she adds is inept and sexist innuendo rather than sex itself humour may be the salvation of an advertisement even if the context for nudity is questionable the itc let a danepak bacon ad off the hook in spite of complaints because it was judged comic rather than voyeuristic the advertisement showed a family of nudists cooking bacon and giving thanks that the low fat product was less likely to spit in the pan than other bacons the trade press continues to present problems for the asa particularly those journals with a predominantly male readership according to crawford there are still ads around with line drawings of buxom women and strap lines which say for example free sex and then go on to say now we ve got your attention lads come and buy our motorbikes the authority got into a scrap last year with a farming publication over an ad for paper sacks a page three girl says crawford was used irrelevantly to advertise the sacks two complaints one from a man and one from a woman were upheld the publication and the company then started lobbying farmers and the asa was accused of being a kill joy and guilty of political correctness you try explaining to a farmer the concept of sexism comments crawford who has some experience as a member of a farming family herself rita clifton at saatchi questions whether this kind of advertising actually works whether it is aimed at men or women clearly advertising needs to grab people s attention the problem is that if you show a lithe 18 year old in a jock strap quite often that will be the only thing that s recalled by women she says unless the product and the figure are properly integrated the product may go unnoticed the mention of jock straps raises the question of whether men are these days as likely as women to be victims of sexist advertising at the very least they may be the victims of stereotyping as an article in the current issue of she magazine points out entitled why the man bashing has to stop it lists the current advertising campaigns which portray men as ranging from dim and uncouth to pushy and insensitive and argues that the campaigns have little appeal to women because women do not want to see old sexist values simply reversed there have been complaints about men and sex in ads the asa annual report for example details the case of the recent britvic orange juice advertisement showing a man with wings holding a magic wand and wearing a posing pouch the strapline read somehow we manage to cram in 12 oranges there were 35 complaints that the ad was offensive but the asa ruled that most readers would appreciate the humour of the image to date however crawford cannot recall a complaint about men in ads having been upheld perhaps that awaits yet another shift in public sensitivities\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4688", "title": "ft 10 mar 94 dorrell to aid investment flow", "body":

be in labour councils he also said that of the 10 lowest taxes five would be levied by conservative controlled councils including westminster wandsworth and ealing but labour said he had chosen an invalid base of comparison by assessing every council on the tax charged to households in band c which applies to properties valued between pounds 52 000 and pounds 68 000 figures from the labour controlled association of metropolitan authorities showed that 82 per cent of households in liverpool which has the most expensive band c tax lived in properties below the band c threshold and would therefore pay less than the amount quoted by mr curry in westminster with the lowest band c tax 84 per cent of households are in properties valued above pounds 68 000 and would therefore pay more mr

showed that on average councils were levying tax increases of 2 7 per cent in the band c range although the survey is not complete this is nearly 4 percentage points below the amount that the

building societies aim to shake off shackles a look at the controversy over the limits to their activities", "body": "even the largest building societies believe they should get a little extra help from the government to compete effectively in the mortgage and savings markets at its meeting today the building societies association council will discuss a paper on the current review of the 1986 legislation on building societies announcing the review in january mr anthony nelson the treasury economic secretary highlighted for discussion areas such as the limit of 40 per cent of funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets merger and takeover procedures and the process for societies to change their status the bsa to which the treasury has sub contracted much of the consultation process believes the chance of a full review with the ending of legislative constraints on societies should not be missed mr adrian coles association director general says some detailed changes it would like could be done reasonably quickly as part of the de regulation initiative mr donald kirkham chief executive of woolwich building society the uk s third largest says in fundamental terms the only thing really pressing down on building societies is the wholesale funding limit societies want greater access to wholesale funds where borrowing is cheaper at present so they can offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers for much of last year they lost market share to the banks but for the medium term the association would still like an end to legislative limits on the powers of societies except those needed to define their mutual status one suggestion for defining mutuality set out in an association paper about 18 months ago is that a society should raise a set proportion of its funds from its members and have a set proportion of its commercial assets as loans to members removing the existing constraints on what societies can do would inevitably mean changes to the way they are regulated the paper was tactful enough to say it would prefer the building societies commission to remain the regulator but acknowledged the argument for moving supervision to the bank of england as differences between banks and societies diminish that prospect was raised by the bank itself when mr brian quinn an executive director gave evidence to the influential commons treasury committee of mps last november mr john watts the tory chairman of the committee says it will pursue this issue when it takes evidence from the commission and the association during its current inquiry into financial regulation there are also broader concerns at westminster mr alistair darling labour s city spokesman says the legislation should allow societies to expand their activities but i would be very reluctant to give them carte blanche to do whatever they like as mr coles puts it the issue is one of efficiency no matter how amenable the building societies commission has been the need for changes in societies powers to be considered by parliament inevitably means delay he says building societies don t want the ability to lend in bosnia and brazil the change would allow us to do things in the markets where we operate in the most efficient way possible but others question whether societies are trying to seize an unfair advantage given the protected environment in which they exist and the lack of shareholders to hold boards accountable mr peter birch chief executive of abbey national the former society which converted to plc status in 1989 dismisses the argument that societies are fully accountable to their members he says that most savers and borrowers do not see themselves as having a controlling role in the society when people go into a building society they do so because the goods are attractive rather than to become members he says his comments seem borne out by members involvement for example at halifax building society the uk s largest only about 10 per cent of its 5 5m voting members took part in decisions at last year s annual general meeting even at nationwide the second largest where the running of the society became such an issue that members insisted on a couple of their own candidates becoming directors only about 103 000 of the 3 5m voting members were involved in voting for the board at last year s agm mr david gilchrist halifax corporate development manager describes the society as happy to look at ways of improving accountability but far from enhancing accountability the most likely immediate changes from the de regulation initiative may reduce the prospects for internal democracy since they are directed at streamlining the occasions and ways for societies to consult and notify their millions of members society chief executives are reluctant to concede the point publicly but some privately admit that greater freedoms should be accompanied by more accountability\n"}, {"id": "FT941-4699",

whether he intends to meet it mr pennant rea told the institute of credit management national conference it is tempting to feel that britain has won the war against inflation so we can now afford to
